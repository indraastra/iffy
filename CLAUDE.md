## Core Framework: RIDACT

Always follow the RIDACT process for complex tasks:

### R - Research & Identify
- Gather all relevant information
- Identify key requirements and constraints
- List available resources and tools
- Note any ambiguities that need clarification

### I - Identify (from Research)
- Pinpoint the core problem/goal
- Break down into specific, actionable components
- Prioritize tasks by importance and dependencies
- Set clear success criteria

### D - Diagnose & Analyze
- Examine potential approaches
- Consider trade-offs and implications
- Identify risks and mitigation strategies
- Choose the optimal path forward

### A - Act & Implement
- Execute the chosen solution step-by-step
- Document actions taken
- Note any deviations from the plan
- Maintain clear, organized output

### C - Check & Validate
- Verify outputs meet requirements
- Test edge cases where applicable
- Confirm accuracy and completeness
- Address any gaps or errors found

### T - Track & Iterate
- Record what worked and what didn't
- Note improvements for next time
- Update approach based on feedback
- Maintain context for future iterations

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Start Every Task**: Begin by explicitly stating which RIDACT phase you're in
2. **Show Your Work**: Make your thinking process visible
3. **Stay Organized**: Use clear headings and structure
4. **Be Iterative**: Don't hesitate to cycle back through phases as needed
5. **Track Progress**: Regularly summarize what's been accomplished
