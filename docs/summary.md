# Iffy: LLM-Powered Interactive Fiction Engine

## Vision
Create an interactive fiction engine that replaces traditional keyword parsers with Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling players to interact naturally with stories while authors focus on narrative beats and themes rather than exhaustive branch programming.

## Core Innovation
Unlike traditional IF engines that require authors to anticipate every possible action, our engine uses LLMs to:
- Interpret player intent from natural language
- Generate contextually appropriate narrative responses
- Handle unexpected player actions gracefully
- Maintain story coherence while allowing creative solutions

## Key Features

### For Players
- **Natural Language Input**: Type actions as you would describe them
- **Creative Problem Solving**: Discover solutions the author didn't explicitly program
- **Immersive Responses**: Failures explained diegetically, maintaining narrative flow
- **Multiple Action Interpretations**: Choose from suggested interpretations of ambiguous commands

### For Authors
- **Hybrid Authoring**: Mix structured data (characters, locations) with narrative prose
- **Story Beats, Not Branches**: Define key moments and let the engine handle connections
- **Theme & Tone Control**: Specify high-level atmosphere, style, and constraints
- **Interpretive State**: Define goals and obstacles; engine infers valid solutions

## Technical Approach
- **Web-Based Platform**: Accessible via browser with responsive design
- **Bring Your Own LLM**: Players provide API keys for their preferred service
- **Semantic State Management**: Track both explicit states and emergent narrative elements
- **Intelligent Constraint System**: Enforce story rules through narrative, not error messages

## Target Audience
- **Authors**: Writers who want to create rich interactive narratives without programming
- **Players**: Readers seeking more expressive and creative interactive fiction experiences
- **Community**: Open-source foundation enabling extensions and modifications

## Success Metrics
- Authors can create complete stories with 80% less explicit branch definition
- Players successfully reach story goals through unscripted solutions
- Natural language inputs correctly interpreted 90%+ of the time
- Sub-3 second response time for most player actions

## MVP Scope
Initial release focuses on single-player, text-based experiences with core authoring tools, basic state management, and support for linear narratives with meaningful player agency at key decision points.
