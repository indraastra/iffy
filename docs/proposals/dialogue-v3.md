# Narrative Beats v3: Unified Story Guidance Beyond Dialogue

**Status:** ðŸ”„ Proposal  
**Priority:** High  
**Scope:** Extends dialogue-v2.md to a comprehensive narrative guidance system

## Executive Summary

Building on dialogue-v2's conversation beats, this proposal expands to a **unified narrative beats system** that guides the LLM through all types of story momentsâ€”not just dialogue. Instead of over-engineering specific interactions, authors define **narrative beats** that the LLM naturally works toward while maintaining emergent creativity.

**Core Insight**: The LLM excels at filling gaps between authored moments. Rather than scripting every detail, authors should define **what should happen** and **when**, letting the LLM determine **how** with rich contextual guidance.

## Reducing LLM Guidelines Redundancy

### **Problem: Current Redundancy**
```yaml
# BEFORE: Manual duplication everywhere
metadata:
  tone:
    overall: "Victorian mystery with technological twist"
    narrative_voice: "Formal, ornate prose"
  themes:
    - "Human vs artificial intelligence"
    - "Detective work in changing times"

characters:
  - id: "quill"
    description: "AI-powered writing instrument"
    traits: ["verbose", "pompous", "helpful"]

llm_story_guidelines: |
  STORY TONE: Victorian mystery with technological twist
  NARRATIVE VOICE: Formal, ornate prose befitting the era
  THEMES: Focus on human vs artificial intelligence, detective work in changing times
  
  QUILL PERSONALITY: The quill is verbose, pompous, yet helpful...
  # Manual repetition of everything above
```

### **Solution: Auto-Generated Context Assembly**
```yaml
# AFTER: Define once, use everywhere
metadata:
  tone:
    overall: "Victorian mystery with technological twist"
    narrative_voice: "Formal, ornate prose befitting the era"
  themes:
    - "Human vs artificial intelligence"  
    - "Detective work in changing times"
  pacing: "methodical_investigation"
  atmosphere: "gaslit_london_1887"

characters:
  - id: "quill"
    name: "The Analytical Engine Quill"
    public:
      appearance: "Fountain pen of unusual design with brass fittings"
      behavior: "Writes of its own accord, makes observations"
    private:
      personality: "Verbose, pompous, yet genuinely helpful"
      motivation: "Prove mechanical reasoning superior to human intuition"
      speech_patterns: "Flowery Victorian prose with calculation undertones"
      relationship_to_player: "Condescending mentor who secretly respects human creativity"

# NO manual llm_story_guidelines needed!
# Engine auto-generates comprehensive context from structured data
```

### **Context Assembly Engine**
```typescript
class ContextAssembler {
  generateStoryContext(story: Story, flow: Flow): string {
    return `
${this.formatToneGuidance(story.metadata.tone)}

${this.formatThemeGuidance(story.metadata.themes)}

${this.formatCharacterDynamics(flow.context_scope.characters, story.characters)}

${this.formatEnvironmentalContext(story.metadata.setting, flow.location)}

${this.formatNarrativeBeats(flow.narrative_beats)}

${this.formatKnowledgeTargets(flow.narrative_beats)}
    `.trim();
  }

  private formatCharacterDynamics(characterIds: string[], allCharacters: Character[]): string {
    const relevantCharacters = allCharacters.filter(c => characterIds.includes(c.id));
    
    return `CHARACTER DYNAMICS:
${relevantCharacters.map(char => `
${char.name}: ${char.private.personality}
- Motivation: ${char.private.motivation}
- Speech: ${char.private.speech_patterns}
- Relationship: ${char.private.relationship_to_player}
`).join('')}`;
  }

  private formatNarrativeBeats(beats: NarrativeBeat[]): string {
    if (!beats?.length) return '';
    
    return `NARRATIVE BEATS TO WORK TOWARD:
${beats.map(beat => `
- ${beat.beat_type.toUpperCase()}: ${this.getBeatGuidance(beat)}
  Emotional Context: ${beat.emotional_context}
  Priority: ${beat.priority}
  ${beat.knowledge_target ? `Sets Knowledge: ${beat.knowledge_target}` : ''}
`).join('')}`;
  }
}
```

```typescript
class BeatManager {
  checkBeatTriggers(playerAction: string, gameState: GameState, flow: Flow): NarrativeBeat[] {
    const activatedBeats: NarrativeBeat[] = [];
    
    for (const beat of flow.narrative_beats || []) {
      if (this.isBeatTriggered(beat, playerAction, gameState)) {
        activatedBeats.push(beat);
        this.scheduleBeatExecution(beat, gameState);
      }
    }
    
    return activatedBeats;
  }
  
  private isBeatTriggered(beat: NarrativeBeat, action: string, state: GameState): boolean {
    // Check various trigger types
    if (beat.trigger.startsWith('player ')) {
      return this.matchesPlayerAction(beat.trigger, action);
    }
    
    if (beat.trigger.startsWith('learned ')) {
      return state.flags.has(beat.trigger.replace('learned ', ''));
    }
    
    if (beat.trigger === 'flow_start') {
      return action === '[FLOW_START]';
    }
    
    // Custom trigger evaluation
    return this.evaluateCustomTrigger(beat.trigger, action, state);
  }
}
```

## Authoring Experience Improvements

### **Beat Templates for Common Patterns**
```yaml
# Template: Investigation Discovery
beat_templates:
  investigation_discovery:
    beat_type: "discovery"
    trigger: "player examines {evidence_item}"
    revelation_guidance: "{evidence_item} reveals {revelation_type}"
    knowledge_target: "{revelation_id}_discovered"
    emotional_context: "investigative breakthrough, pieces falling into place"
    priority: "important"

# Template: Character Vulnerability Moment  
  character_vulnerability:
    beat_type: "emotional"
    trigger: "{vulnerability_trigger}"
    emotional_guidance: "{character_name}'s emotional walls come down"
    character_impact: "{character_id}_becomes_vulnerable"
    behavioral_changes: "increased openness, emotional availability"
    priority: "critical"

# Usage in story:
flows:
  - id: "evidence_analysis"
    narrative_beats:
      - template: "investigation_discovery"
        evidence_item: "blood_sample"
        revelation_type: "DNA mismatch with suspect"
        revelation_id: "dna_evidence"
        
      - template: "character_vulnerability"
        character_name: "Forensics Expert"
        character_id: "expert"
        vulnerability_trigger: "dna_evidence_discovered"
```

### **Beat Validation and Testing**
```typescript
interface BeatValidation {
  validateBeats(flow: Flow): ValidationResult {
    const issues: string[] = [];
    
    // Check for orphaned knowledge targets
    const beatTargets = flow.narrative_beats?.map(b => b.knowledge_target).filter(Boolean) || [];
    const referencedTargets = this.findKnowledgeReferences(flow.completion_transitions);
    
    beatTargets.forEach(target => {
      if (!referencedTargets.includes(target)) {
        issues.push(`Knowledge target "${target}" is set by beat but never referenced`);
      }
    });
    
    // Check for impossible trigger sequences
    this.validateTriggerLogic(flow.narrative_beats, issues);
    
    // Check for missing emotional context
    flow.narrative_beats?.forEach(beat => {
      if (!beat.emotional_context) {
        issues.push(`Beat "${beat.beat_type}" missing emotional_context guidance`);
      }
    });
    
    return { valid: issues.length === 0, issues };
  }
}
```

### **Beat Analytics and Optimization**
```typescript
interface BeatAnalytics {
  // Track which beats trigger successfully
  beat_activation_rate: Map<string, number>;
  
  // Monitor emotional flow effectiveness  
  emotional_progression_success: Map<string, number>;
  
  // Identify unused beats for optimization
  orphaned_beats: string[];
  
  // Token efficiency of beat guidance
  token_usage_per_beat: Map<string, number>;
}

class BeatOptimizer {
  optimizeBeatGuidance(beats: NarrativeBeat[], tokenBudget: number): NarrativeBeat[] {
    // Prioritize critical beats
    const critical = beats.filter(b => b.priority === 'critical');
    const important = beats.filter(b => b.priority === 'important');
    const background = beats.filter(b => b.priority === 'background');
    
    let optimizedBeats = [...critical];
    let remainingTokens = tokenBudget - this.estimateTokens(critical);
    
    // Add important beats if space allows
    for (const beat of important) {
      const beatTokens = this.estimateTokens([beat]);
      if (remainingTokens >= beatTokens) {
        optimizedBeats.push(beat);
        remainingTokens -= beatTokens;
      }
    }
    
    // Compress guidance for background beats
    for (const beat of background) {
      if (remainingTokens > 50) {
        optimizedBeats.push(this.compressBeatGuidance(beat));
        remainingTokens -= 50;
      }
    }
    
    return optimizedBeats;
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Narrative Beats v3 evolves beyond dialogue to encompass all aspects of story guidance. By defining **what should happen** rather than **exactly how**, authors provide rich guidance while preserving the LLM's natural storytelling strengths.

The system transforms authoring from "scripting interactions" to "guiding experiences" - maintaining narrative intent while allowing emergent creativity to flourish. Combined with context scoping and auto-generated guidance, this creates scalable, maintainable stories that feel both authored and alive.

This approach leverages our recent improvements (centralized theming, emergent content, flow transitions) while addressing the core challenge: how to guide LLM storytelling without constraining its creative potential.
