# Player Freedom Tuning

**Status:** ðŸ’¡ New Proposal  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Motivation:** Allow authors to control how much creative improvisation and freedom players have during gameplay

## Problem Statement

In the current system, the LLM's interpretation of player actions can be either too restrictive or too permissive for the author's intent. For example, in `sandwich_crisis_v2.yaml`, players may want to add pickles to their sandwich, but the engine might reject this action because it's not explicitly mentioned in the story items or success conditions.

Authors need a way to tune the balance between:
- **Story coherence** (staying true to authored content)  
- **Player agency** (allowing reasonable improvisation and creativity)

## Proposed Solution: Freedom Level Setting

Add a simple `player_freedom` setting to story metadata with three levels:

### LOW Freedom (Strict Adherence)
- Players can only interact with explicitly defined items and locations
- Actions must closely match authored content and success conditions
- LLM rejects improvised actions that aren't directly supported by the story definition
- Best for: Puzzle games, mysteries with specific solutions, educational content

### MEDIUM Freedom (Guided Flexibility) 
- Players can perform reasonable actions with authored items
- LLM allows logical extensions (e.g., adding pickles to sandwich if condiments exist)
- Improvised actions succeed if they don't conflict with core story goals
- Best for: Most interactive fiction, adventure games

### HIGH Freedom (Creative Sandbox)
- Players can introduce new elements and take creative liberties
- LLM prioritizes "yes, and..." approach to player actions
- Only blocks actions that would completely break the story world or safety guidelines
- Best for: Creative writing collaboration, experimental narratives

## Implementation

### Story Metadata
```yaml
metadata:
  player_freedom: "medium"  # low | medium | high
  # ... other metadata
```

### Engine Integration (Zero Author Burden)
The freedom level is handled entirely by the game engine. Authors just set the level - no additional guidelines needed.

**Engine Implementation:**
```typescript
// In GamePromptBuilder or AnthropicService
private buildFreedomGuidelines(freedomLevel: string): string {
  const guidelines = {
    low: `
PLAYER FREEDOM: STRICT ADHERENCE
- Only allow interactions with explicitly defined items and locations
- Reject improvised actions not directly supported by story definition
- Actions must closely match authored content and success conditions
- When players try unsupported actions, redirect to available options`,
    
    medium: `
PLAYER FREEDOM: GUIDED FLEXIBILITY  
- Allow reasonable improvisation with authored items and locations
- Accept logical extensions that don't conflict with core story goals
- Players can discover plausible items in appropriate locations
- Encourage creativity while maintaining story coherence`,
    
    high: `
PLAYER FREEDOM: CREATIVE SANDBOX
- Prioritize "yes, and..." approach to player actions
- Allow players to introduce new elements and take creative liberties
- Only block actions that would completely break story world
- Embrace improvisation and collaborative storytelling`
  };
  
  return guidelines[freedomLevel] || guidelines.medium;
}
```

The freedom guidelines are automatically injected into the system prompt, so authors never need to write them.

## Examples

### LOW Freedom Example
```
Player: "I add some pickles to my sandwich"
LLM: "You look around but don't see any pickles available. The [item:cheese of last hope] and [item:mystery condiment] are your only options for the sandwich."
```

### MEDIUM Freedom Example  
```
Player: "I add some pickles to my sandwich"
LLM: "You rummage through the [location:refrigerator zone] and find a jar of pickles hiding behind the [item:cheese]! You add a few tangy slices to your sandwich creation."
```

### HIGH Freedom Example
```
Player: "I add pickles and also some leftover pizza from yesterday"
LLM: "In a stroke of culinary GENIUS, you discover forgotten pizza in the depths of your refrigerator! The combination of [item:cheese], pickles, and cold pizza creates the most UNCONVENTIONAL sandwich in the history of lunch!"
```

## Benefits

1. **Zero Author Burden**: Authors just set one simple field - engine handles all guidelines
2. **Author Control**: Clear, simple setting to match gameplay to story intent  
3. **Player Clarity**: Players learn the "rules" quickly through consistent feedback
4. **Reusability**: Same story can be tuned for different audiences (strict puzzle vs. creative sandbox)
5. **Implementation Simplicity**: Engine automatically injects appropriate guidelines into system prompt

## Default Behavior

If no `player_freedom` is specified, default to `medium` as it balances story coherence with reasonable player agency.

## Future Extensions

- Per-location freedom overrides (`kitchen: high`, `vault: low`)
- Dynamic freedom that changes based on story progress
- Author-defined custom freedom rules for specific items or actions

## Story Example

```yaml
title: "The Great Sandwich Crisis v2"
# ... existing content

metadata:
  player_freedom: "medium"  # Allow reasonable sandwich customization
  setting:
    time: "A fateful Tuesday afternoon, 12:17 PM"
    # ... rest of metadata

# No additional llm_story_guidelines needed - engine handles freedom level automatically!
llm_story_guidelines: |
  STORY GOAL: Player should find bread and cheese to make a winning sandwich...
  # Only story-specific guidelines, no freedom rules needed
```

**Result:** Players can add reasonable sandwich ingredients (pickles, lettuce, etc.) while maintaining the dramatic soap opera tone and core success conditions. The engine automatically injects the appropriate freedom guidelines based on the `medium` setting.
