# LLM-IF Engine: Comprehensive Requirements Document

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The LLM-IF Engine enables creation and playing of interactive fiction where natural language processing via Large Language Models replaces traditional command parsing, allowing for more fluid and creative player interactions.

### 1.2 Scope
This document covers all envisioned features for the complete system, including those beyond MVP scope.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Story Definition System

#### 2.1.1 Hybrid Markup Language
- Support YAML for structured metadata (themes, UI styling, configuration)
- Support Markdown for narrative content and dialogue
- Allow mixing of declarative and narrative elements
- Provide clear syntax for beats, characters, locations, and rules

#### 2.1.2 Story Components
- **Metadata**: Title, author, themes, tone, atmosphere, UI styling
- **Characters**: Traits, speaking style, relationships, knowledge state
- **Locations**: Descriptions, connections, objects, ambient details
- **Story Beats**: Required/optional, prerequisites, transitions
- **Dialogue Trees**: For critical conversations with branching
- **Dynamic Rules**: Generation constraints, world rules, pacing

### 2.2 Runtime Engine

#### 2.2.1 Player Input Processing
- Accept natural language commands
- Generate multiple interpretations for ambiguous inputs
- Present interpretations as multiple-choice when needed
- Support both actions and dialogue

#### 2.2.2 State Management
- Track explicit states (inventory, locations, flags)
- Maintain semantic state (relationships, knowledge, emergent properties)
- Store narrative memory (key events, unique solutions)
- Support state querying by semantic meaning

#### 2.2.3 Narrative Generation
- Generate appropriate prose matching story tone
- Maintain character voice consistency
- Incorporate atmospheric elements
- Use author-provided beats as style examples

#### 2.2.4 Constraint Enforcement
- Apply hard constraints (world rules, anachronisms)
- Respect soft constraints (character reluctance, social norms)
- Provide diegetic rejections for impossible actions
- Allow creative solutions within constraints

### 2.3 Author Tools

#### 2.3.1 Story Validation
- Check story completeness
- Verify beat reachability
- Validate character and location references
- Identify potential dead ends

#### 2.3.2 Testing Framework
- Support automated playthroughs
- Log state changes and decision points
- Generate coverage reports
- Allow replay of specific paths

#### 2.3.3 Development Environment
- Syntax highlighting for story markup
- Real-time validation
- Preview functionality
- Debug state inspection

### 2.4 Player Interface

#### 2.4.1 Web Application
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Clean, customizable UI based on story styling
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Accessibility compliance

#### 2.4.2 Game Features
- Save/load game states
- Session history
- Text size and contrast controls
- Optional hints or goal reminders

### 2.5 Platform Features

#### 2.5.1 LLM Integration
- Provider-agnostic API framework
- Initial support for Anthropic Claude
- "Bring Your Own Key" model
- Graceful fallback for API failures

#### 2.5.2 Performance Optimization
- Response caching for common situations
- Intelligent context window management
- Parallel processing where possible
- Progressive loading of story content

#### 2.5.3 Analytics
- Track player choices and paths
- Measure response latencies
- Monitor LLM token usage
- Generate author-facing reports

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
- Response time under 3 seconds for 90% of actions
- Support stories up to 100,000 words
- Handle play sessions up to 4 hours
- Manage context windows up to 100k tokens

### 3.2 Reliability
- Graceful handling of LLM API failures
- Auto-save every significant action
- Recovery from browser crashes
- Consistent state across sessions

### 3.3 Usability
- Intuitive interface requiring no tutorial
- Clear feedback for all actions
- Helpful error messages
- Consistent interaction patterns

### 3.4 Extensibility
- Open-source codebase
- Documented story format
- Plugin architecture for tools
- Community contribution support

### 3.5 Security
- Secure API key handling
- No server-side key storage
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting for API calls

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Architecture
- Frontend: Modern web framework (React/Vue/Svelte)
- State Management: Hybrid local/semantic storage
- LLM Integration: Abstracted provider interface
- Story Compiler: Parser for markup language

### 4.2 Data Storage
