## The Impressionist Format

Sketch out your story world and let the AI paint the details. Perfect for writers who want emergence without losing narrative control:

```yaml
title: "The Locked Door"
context: "You need to get through a locked door."

scenes:
  - id: "locked_door"
    sketch: |
      You stand before a heavy wooden door, its surface worn smooth 
      by countless hands. The iron handle refuses to budge - definitely 
      locked. The keyhole stares at you like a dark eye, taunting in 
      its simplicity. There must be a way through.
    leads_to:
      found_solution: "when the player finds a way through"

endings:
  variations:
    - id: "success"
      when: "player exits through the unlocked door"
      sketch: "You step into the unknown."
```

Players can type anything they want‚Äî"examine the keyhole," "break down the door," "look for another way around"‚Äîand the AI responds intelligently while maintaining your story's atmosphere and direction.
