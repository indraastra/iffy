**✨ Perfect for fan fiction writers, interactive storytellers, and anyone who loves choice-driven narratives!**

## ⚠️ Important Notice: Dialogue Flows

**Current Limitation:** The dialogue flow system (`type: "dialogue"`) is currently broken and non-functional. While the story format supports dialogue flows, they do not properly trigger or execute in the current engine implementation.

**Workaround:** Use `type: "narrative"` flows instead. The AI naturally handles character conversations and dialogue through narrative flows, often creating more compelling interactions than rigid dialogue trees would provide.

**Status:** This is a **major TODO** item. See our [Dialogue System v2 Proposal](./docs/proposals/dialogue-v2.md) for the planned redesign that will address these issues and create a more elegant conversation system.

**Impact:** Most story types work perfectly (mysteries, adventures, explorations), but branching conversation stories may need to rely on narrative flow structure for now.

## 🤔 Why Iffy Instead of ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini?

**Fair question!** Modern AI chat products are powerful and stateful. Here's what Iffy offers that's different:

### 📦 **Shareable, Reproducible Stories**
- **Iffy:** Authors write once → thousands play the exact same story with consistent rules
- **Chat products:** Each player needs the full story setup and results vary between sessions

### 🎯 **Guaranteed Story Structure**
- **Iffy:** The mystery jar is ALWAYS fish sauce, endings trigger predictably
- **Chat products:** Even with instructions, outcomes and story elements can vary

### 🎮 **Zero Fiction Maintenance**
- **Iffy:** Players just type "examine the desk" - no prompt engineering needed
- **Chat products:** Players must actively maintain the fiction and remember game rules

### ✨ **Purpose-Built Features**
- **Iffy:** Rich text rendering, save/load system, inventory display, validated state changes
- **Chat products:** Everything lives in chat bubbles, no specialized IF features

**Bottom line:** Iffy is for **creating and distributing** interactive fiction. It's not about what's impossible elsewhere - it's about what's **friction-free and purpose-built** for IF authors and players.

## 🎯 What Makes Iffy Special

## 🌟 Inspiration & Acknowledgments

Iffy stands on the shoulders of giants in interactive fiction and AI storytelling:

### **Inkle's Ink**
The brilliant [Ink narrative scripting language](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) showed us how powerful a purpose-built language for interactive stories could be. While Iffy uses YAML for accessibility, Ink's approach to branching narratives and state management deeply influenced our design philosophy.

### **AI Dungeon**
[AI Dungeon](https://aidungeon.io/) pioneered AI-driven interactive storytelling, proving that language models could create compelling emergent narratives. Iffy builds on this foundation by adding structured authorship - giving writers control while preserving the magic of AI-powered natural language understanding.

Together, these inspirations led to Iffy's unique approach: **structured stories with emergent gameplay**, where authors define the world and AI brings it to life through natural conversation.
