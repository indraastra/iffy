# Iffy - Interactive Fiction for Everyone

Create and play interactive stories powered by AI. Write adventures, mysteries, romances, fan fiction, or any narrative you can imagine - then play them with natural language commands like "examine the mysterious door" or "ask the detective about the case."

**‚ú® Perfect for fan fiction writers, interactive storytellers, and anyone who loves choice-driven narratives!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice: Dialogue Flows

**Current Limitation:** The dialogue flow system (`type: "dialogue"`) is currently broken and non-functional. While the story format supports dialogue flows, they do not properly trigger or execute in the current engine implementation.

**Workaround:** Use `type: "narrative"` flows instead. The AI naturally handles character conversations and dialogue through narrative flows, often creating more compelling interactions than rigid dialogue trees would provide.

**Status:** This is a **major TODO** item. See our [Dialogue System v2 Proposal](./docs/proposals/dialogue-v2.md) for the planned redesign that will address these issues and create a more elegant conversation system.

**Impact:** Most story types work perfectly (mysteries, adventures, explorations), but branching conversation stories may need to rely on narrative flow structure for now.

## üéØ What Makes Iffy Special

### ü§ñ **AI-Powered Natural Language**
Instead of typing rigid commands like "go north," you can write naturally:
- *"I want to examine that mysterious door more closely"*
- *"Ask the detective what they think happened here"*  
- *"Search around the room for anything useful"*
- *"Tell Alex how I really feel about them"*

The AI understands your intent and responds contextually to your story.
