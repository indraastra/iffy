# Iffy Impressionist - AI-Powered Interactive Fiction

Create stories that come alive through natural conversation. Iffy combines the best of traditional interactive fiction with modern AI, letting players explore your worlds through natural language while keeping your story structure intact.

**Perfect for writers who want to create interactive stories without losing creative control.**

## What Makes This Special?

### Two Story Formats, One Engine
- **Traditional Format**: Structured flows and precise branching for classic IF experiences
- **Impressionist Format**: Sketch-based storytelling that adapts naturally to player creativity
- **Same Engine**: Both formats run on the same powerful AI-driven foundation

### Natural Language Gaming
Type "examine the mysterious door" or "ask the detective about the case" - no memorizing command lists or rigid syntax. The AI understands what you mean and responds authentically within your story's world.

### Creative Freedom with Structure
Authors define the world, characters, and story beats. The AI handles the conversation, bringing your vision to life while respecting your narrative boundaries.

## Story Formats Explained

### Impressionist Format (Recommended for Beginners)
Sketch out scenes and let the AI fill in the details naturally:

```yaml
title: "The Detective's Office"
context: "A noir mystery in 1940s Los Angeles"

scenes:
  - id: "office_investigation"
    sketch: |
      The private detective's office is dimly lit, papers scattered 
      across the desk. A half-empty bottle of whiskey catches the 
      streetlight. Something important is hidden here.
    leads_to:
      found_clue: "when the player discovers the hidden evidence"
```

Perfect for emergent storytelling where player creativity drives the narrative forward.

### Traditional Format (For Detailed Control)
Define exact flows, character dialogue, and branching paths:

```yaml
title: "The Mansion Mystery"
characters:
  - id: "butler"
    name: "James"
    traits: ["formal", "secretive"]

flows:
  - id: "meet_butler"
    type: "dialogue"
    participants: ["butler", "player"]
    exchanges:
      - speaker: "butler"
        text: "Good evening. I'm afraid the master is not receiving visitors."
```

Ideal for authors who want precise control over dialogue and story branching.

**Shareable Stories**: Write once, share with thousands. Your story maintains consistency across all players.

**No Prompt Engineering**: Players just play - they don't need to maintain the fiction or remember complex rules.

**Purpose-Built Features**: Save/load systems, rich text formatting, inventory tracking, and specialized IF interfaces.
