# Iffy - Interactive Fiction Engine

An impressionistic and interpretive approach to interactive storytelling. Iffy lets you sketch story worlds that adapt and respond to player creativity through natural conversation, bringing fiction to life with AI-powered understanding.

**For creators**: Writers and storytellers who want to craft interactive experiences where players can type anything ‚Äî not just choose from menus ‚Äî without learning to code.

**For players**: Those who love story-driven games and want true freedom to interact naturally, typing whatever comes to mind instead of clicking predetermined choices.

### Why Not ChatGPT?

While AI assistants are powerful, Iffy offers something different:

**Shareable Stories**: Write once, share with thousands. Your story maintains consistency across all players.

**No Prompt Engineering**: Players just play ‚Äî they don't need to maintain the fiction or coach the AI.

**Purpose-Built Features**: Save/load systems, rich text formatting, memory tracking, and specialized interactive fiction interfaces.

**Guaranteed Outcomes**: Key story beats happen when they should. That door opens when players solve the puzzle.

**Community Focus**: Export stories, share creations, and build on others' work.

## The Format

Sketch your story world and let the AI paint in the details. Perfect for writers who want emergence without losing narrative control.

Players can type anything they want ‚Äî "examine the keyhole," "break down the door," "look for another way around" ‚Äî and the AI responds intelligently while maintaining your story's atmosphere and direction.
