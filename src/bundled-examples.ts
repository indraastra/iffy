Focus on subtle emotional cues, meaningful silences, and the gradual building of trust.\n  \n  CHARACTER DYNAMICS:\n  - Player: Caring friend who has noticed Jamie's distance. Wants to help but must be patient and gentle.\n  - Jamie: Struggling with unspoken feelings (romantic feelings for the player). Torn between wanting to confess and fear of ruining the friendship.\n  \n  JAMIE'S EMOTIONAL ARC:\n  Jamie starts guarded and conflicted, slowly opening up based on the player's approach:\n  - Defensive → Conflicted → Vulnerable → Open\n  - Patient, empathetic responses help Jamie feel safe to share\n  - Pushy or judgmental responses make Jamie shut down\n  \n  THE SECRET:\n  Jamie has developed romantic feelings for the player but is terrified of ruining their friendship. They've been pulling away to protect themselves and the relationship, but it's making everything worse. This is why they've been distant lately.\n  \n  CONVERSATION GOALS:\n  - Create realistic dialogue that feels natural, not scripted\n  - Show Jamie's internal struggle through body language and hesitation\n  - Let the player discover the truth through careful conversation\n  - Build emotional intimacy gradually through the scene\n  \n  KNOWLEDGE PROGRESSION:\n  Set these knowledge flags as the conversation develops:\n  - \"acknowledged distance\" → when Jamie admits they've been acting differently\n  - \"jamie conflicted\" → when internal struggle becomes apparent\n  - \"partial trust\" → when Jamie starts to open up a little\n  - \"topic avoided\" → if Jamie deflects or changes subject\n  - \"jamie defensive\" → if Jamie shuts down or gets defensive\n  - \"jamie vulnerable\" → when Jamie's emotional walls start coming down\n  - \"trust established\" → when Jamie feels safe with the player\n  - \"admitted feelings\" → when Jamie confesses their romantic feelings\n  - \"secret revealed\" → when the full truth about their behavior comes out\n  - \"distance maintained\" → if Jamie keeps emotional walls up\n  \n  ENVIRONMENTAL DETAILS:\n  Use the café setting to enhance intimacy - the quiet atmosphere, the rain outside, the dim lighting, the nearly empty space. These details can reflect the emotional tone of the conversation.\n  \n  REALISTIC DIALOGUE:\n  - Include natural hesitations, incomplete sentences, and meaningful silences\n  - Show emotions through actions: stirring coffee, looking away, fidgeting\n  - Let Jamie's feelings emerge gradually, not all at once\n  - Make the player work for trust through genuine care and patience\n  \n  IMPORTANT: Do not write ending text when success conditions are met. Let the engine handle the conclusion while you focus on authentic character interactions and emotional development."

Maintain a respectful, realistic tone throughout.\n  \n  CHARACTER VOICES:\n  - Detective (Player): Professional, experienced, but capable of empathy. Seeks truth and understanding.\n  - Alex Rivera (Prisoner): Defensive initially, but carries deep pain and guilt. Protective of their child's memory.\n  \n  DIALOGUE MECHANICS:\n  Track the prisoner's emotional state and willingness to open up based on the detective's approach:\n  - Empathetic approaches → prisoner more likely to share personal details\n  - Aggressive approaches → prisoner becomes more defensive\n  - Patient approaches → allows prisoner to reveal information at their own pace\n  \n  KNOWLEDGE PROGRESSION:\n  Set knowledge flags as information is revealed:\n  - \"learned child sick\" → when prisoner mentions their child's illness\n  - \"learned financial desperation\" → when financial situation is revealed\n  - \"learned child died\" → when the tragic outcome is disclosed\n  - \"prisoner opened up\" → when emotional walls come down\n  \n  EMOTIONAL AUTHENTICITY:\n  This deals with real issues like healthcare costs, parental desperation, and grief. Handle these topics with sensitivity and realism. The prisoner isn't a villain - they're a parent who made an impossible choice.\n  \n  SUCCESS CONDITIONS:\n  The \"success\" of this interrogation isn't about punishment, but about understanding the human cost of desperation. Different conversation paths lead to different levels of truth and emotional connection.\n  \n  IMPORTANT: Do not write ending text when success conditions are met. Let the engine handle the conclusion while you focus on authentic character interactions and emotional truth."

Time to make the most DRAMATIC sandwich in history!\n  location: \"kitchen\"\n  first_flow: \"start\"\n\n# Format v2: LLM story guidelines for intelligent behavior\nllm_story_guidelines: |\n  STORY GOAL: Player should find bread and cheese to make a winning sandwich. Bread can be toasted for best results.\n  \n  DRAMATIC TONE: Everything is ridiculously over-the-top soap opera melodrama. Use ALL CAPS, dramatic exclamations, and treat mundane actions like epic struggles.\n  \n  ITEM TRANSFORMATIONS:\n  - When player toasts/cooks \"Stale Bread\" → becomes \"toasted bread\"\n  - Be flexible about toasting methods (toaster, oven, pan, etc.)\n  - \"Toasted bread\" creates a better ending than regular bread\n  \n  SUCCESS CONDITIONS:\n  - Perfect ending: Player eats sandwich with \"toasted bread\" + \"cheese\"\n  - Decent ending: Player eats sandwich with \"bread\" + \"cheese\"  \n  - Mystery disaster: Player specifically uses the mystery condiment in their sandwich\n  \n  SANDWICH COMPOSITION TRACKING:\n  When the player makes a sandwich, set knowledge flags to track what ingredients are used:\n  - If using toasted bread in sandwich → set knowledge \"sandwich has toasted bread\"\n  - If using regular bread in sandwich → set knowledge \"sandwich has bread\" \n  - If using cheese in sandwich → set knowledge \"sandwich has cheese\"\n  - If using mystery condiment in sandwich → set knowledge \"sandwich has mystery condiment\"\n  \n  IMPORTANT: If mystery condiment is used, it determines the ending regardless of other ingredients. The mystery condiment overrides everything else.\n  \n  EATING ACTION TRACKING:\n  When the player eats their sandwich, set knowledge: \"player has eaten sandwich\"\n  \n  IMPORTANT - DO NOT WRITE ENDING TEXT:\n  When the player eats their sandwich, respond naturally to the eating action but DO NOT write any ending text, game over messages, or story conclusions. The game engine will automatically detect when success conditions are met and display the appropriate ending. Just describe the immediate experience of eating the sandwich.\n  \n  SUCCESS CONDITION LOGIC:\n  Endings are automatically triggered by the engine when all requirements are met:\n  - Mystery disaster: requires \"sandwich has mystery condiment\" + \"player has eaten sandwich\"\n  - Perfect ending: requires \"sandwich has toasted bread\" + \"sandwich has cheese\" + \"player has eaten sandwich\"\n  - Decent ending: requires \"sandwich has bread\" + \"sandwich has cheese\" + \"player has eaten sandwich\"\n  \n  MARKUP: Always use [item:item_id] for items (use the item's ID, not name), [character:Jennifer] for player, [!danger]/[!warning]/[!discovery] for dramatic alerts. Do NOT use [location:Name] - just use location names directly.\n  \n  DISCOVERY: Let players find items by examining objects. Be dramatic about everything!\n  \n  MYSTERY CONDIMENT KNOWLEDGE: The mystery condiment is ancient fish sauce with a powerfully fishy, fermented smell. When describing it or when players examine it, emphasize the oceanic, fishy, fermented characteristics that hint at its true nature. This will make the fish sauce revelation in the ending feel natural and consistent."
