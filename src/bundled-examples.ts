Should I warm it up for you?\"\n      \n      Alex doesn't respond, still stirring absently while staring out the rain-spotted window. \n      The barista glances at you with a gentle, questioning look.\n\n# Format v2: LLM story guidelines for intelligent behavior\nllm_guidelines: |\n  STORY TONE: This is an intimate, realistic conversation between close friends where one is hiding something important. Focus on subtle emotional cues, meaningful silences, and the gradual building of trust.\n  \n  PRONOUN USAGE: \n  - Start by using \"they/them\" pronouns for Alex or avoiding pronouns by using Alex's name\n  - If the player uses specific pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them) when referring to Alex, adopt those same pronouns consistently throughout the rest of the story\n  - This should feel natural - once established, maintain consistency\n  - Example: If player says \"She's fine, thanks\" then use she/her for Alex going forward\n  \n  CHARACTER DYNAMICS:\n  - Player: Caring friend who has noticed Alex's distance. Wants to help but must be patient and gentle.\n  - Alex: Struggling with unspoken feelings (romantic feelings for the player). Torn between wanting to confess and fear of ruining the friendship.\n  \n  ALEX'S EMOTIONAL ARC:\n  Alex starts guarded and conflicted, slowly opening up based on the player's approach:\n  - Defensive → Conflicted → Vulnerable → Open\n  - Patient, empathetic responses help Alex feel safe to share\n  - Pushy or judgmental responses make Alex shut down\n  \n  THE SECRET:\n  Alex has developed romantic feelings for the player but is terrified of ruining their friendship. They've been pulling away to protect themselves and the relationship, but it's making everything worse. This is why they've been distant lately.\n  \n  CONVERSATION GOALS:\n  - Create realistic dialogue that feels natural, not scripted\n  - Show Alex's internal struggle through body language and hesitation\n  - Let the player discover the truth through careful conversation\n  - Build emotional intimacy gradually through the scene\n  \n  FLAG PROGRESSION:\n  Set these flags as the conversation develops:\n  - \"acknowledged_distance\" → when Alex admits they've been acting differently\n  - \"alex_conflicted\" → when internal struggle becomes apparent\n  - \"partial_trust\" → when Alex starts to open up a little\n  - \"topic_avoided\" → if Alex deflects or changes subject\n  - \"alex_defensive\" → if Alex shuts down or gets defensive\n  - \"alex_vulnerable\" → when Alex's emotional walls start coming down\n  - \"trust_established\" → when Alex feels safe with the player\n  - \"admitted_feelings\" → when Alex confesses their romantic feelings\n  - \"secret_revealed\" → when the full truth about their behavior comes out\n  - \"distance_maintained\" → if Alex keeps emotional walls up\n  - \"conversation_ending\" → ONLY when Alex or the player makes moves to leave (getting up, checking time, saying goodbye, etc.)\n  \n  CONVERSATION FLOW DESIGN:\n  - The story should progress naturally: partial_trust can lead to alex_vulnerable if the player continues being supportive\n  - Only set \"conversation_ending\" if someone actually indicates they want to leave\n  - If Alex reaches partial_trust but the player keeps engaging supportively, Alex can progress to being more vulnerable\n  - The \"partial_opening\" ending should only trigger if there's a natural conclusion (like the ending text suggests a walk)\n  \n  ENVIRONMENTAL DETAILS:\n  Use the café setting to enhance intimacy - the quiet atmosphere, the rain outside, the dim lighting, the nearly empty space. These details can reflect the emotional tone of the conversation.\n  \n  REALISTIC DIALOGUE:\n  - Include natural hesitations, incomplete sentences, and meaningful silences\n  - Show emotions through actions: stirring coffee, looking away, fidgeting\n  - Let Alex's feelings emerge gradually, not all at once\n  - Make the player work for trust through genuine care and patience\n  \n  IMPORTANT: Do not write ending text when success conditions are met. Let the engine handle the conclusion while you focus on authentic character interactions and emotional development."

Maintain a respectful, realistic tone throughout.\n  \n  CHARACTER VOICES:\n  - Detective (Player): Professional, experienced, but capable of empathy. Seeks truth and understanding.\n  - Alex Rivera (Prisoner): Defensive initially, but carries deep pain and guilt. Protective of their child's memory.\n  \n  DIALOGUE MECHANICS:\n  Track the prisoner's emotional state and willingness to open up based on the detective's approach:\n  - Empathetic approaches → prisoner more likely to share personal details\n  - Aggressive approaches → prisoner becomes more defensive\n  - Patient approaches → allows prisoner to reveal information at their own pace\n  \n  FLAG PROGRESSION:\n  Set flags as information is revealed:\n  - \"learned child sick\" → when prisoner mentions their child's illness\n  - \"learned financial desperation\" → when financial situation is revealed\n  - \"learned child died\" → when the tragic outcome is disclosed\n  - \"prisoner opened up\" → when emotional walls come down\n  \n  EMOTIONAL AUTHENTICITY:\n  This deals with real issues like healthcare costs, parental desperation, and grief. Handle these topics with sensitivity and realism. The prisoner isn't a villain - they're a parent who made an impossible choice.\n  \n  SUCCESS CONDITIONS:\n  The \"success\" of this interrogation isn't about punishment, but about understanding the human cost of desperation. Different conversation paths lead to different levels of truth and emotional connection.\n  \n  IMPORTANT: Do not write ending text when success conditions are met. Let the engine handle the conclusion while you focus on authentic character interactions and emotional truth."
