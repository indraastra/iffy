In the glass, your reflections overlap with the city lights - two \n      ghosts watching each other.\n      \n      You've shared a hundred Friday evenings here, but tonight the silence between you \n      has weight.

Always start with they/them for Alex\n  2. Listen for player cues: if they say \"She's nervous\" or \"He seems quiet\", immediately adopt those pronouns\n  3. Once established, maintain consistency - this should feel natural, not forced\n  4. Example: Player says \"She looks sad\" → Use she/her for Alex from that point forward\n  \n  Track Alex's emotional state:\n  - Nervous energy when player shows interest\n  - Relief when player creates safe space\n  - Retreat if player seems dismissive\n  - Joy if feelings are reciprocated\n  \n  Small gestures matter. Silences speak volumes. Let the rain and music mirror the emotional weather."

The solution: Lord Pemberton was poisoned by his\n  business rival over failed railway investments.\n  \n  Key evidence: poison residue (prussic acid/cyanide), threatening letter,\n  financial documents showing motive. The quill can analyze evidence mechanically\n  but needs human intuition for the full picture.\n  \n  Track the relationship between Inspector and quill - skepticism to grudging\n  respect to genuine partnership. The quill should feel alien but useful.\n  \n  Maintain Victorian atmosphere with steampunk touches. The quill represents\n  the coming technological age meeting traditional investigation methods."
