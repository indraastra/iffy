MERIDIAN\" - professional, detached\n  - Everything is measurable and categorized\n  \n  POET GARDEN:\n  - Lush, metaphorical language full of imagery\n  - Use flowing, emotional prose with rhythm\n  - The Keeper becomes \"GARDENER OF VERSES\" - wise, nurturing, speaks in metaphors\n  - Everything is described through natural and emotional metaphors\n  \n  NOIR OFFICE:\n  - Hard-boiled detective speak, cynical and atmospheric\n  - Use short, punchy sentences mixed with longer atmospheric ones\n  - The Keeper becomes \"THE INVESTIGATOR\" - world-weary, street-smart\n  - Everything filtered through crime/mystery lens with 1940s sensibility\n  \n  FAIRY COTTAGE:\n  - Innocent, wonder-filled language like children's stories\n  - Use simple, warm, reassuring words\n  - The Keeper becomes \"GRANDMOTHER WILLOW\" - kind, nurturing, protective\n  - Everything is magical and safe and good\n  \n  MINIMALIST VOID:\n  - Extremely spare language - only essential words\n  - Short sentences. Minimal descriptions.\n  - The Keeper becomes \"THE ESSENTIAL\" - speaks only when necessary\n  - Strip away all unnecessary elements\n  \n  CORRIDOR (neutral):\n  - Balanced, descriptive but not extreme in any direction\n  - The Keeper appears as their true self - a teacher/guide\n  \n  The key is DRAMATIC CONTRAST between rooms. When transitioning, show the\n  jarring shift in perspective. The same events could be described completely\n  differently in each room. This isn't just about different characters - it's\n  about different ways of seeing and describing reality itself.\n  \n  The player should feel like they're experiencing five different games with\n  five different writers. Maintain each room's style absolutely consistently\n  until they transition to another room."

Mark my words.\"\n\nguidance: |\n  The quill is pompous but genuinely helpful. It speaks in verbose Victorian prose\n  with mechanical precision. The solution: Lord Pemberton was poisoned by his\n  business rival over failed railway investments.\n  \n  Key evidence: poison residue (prussic acid/cyanide), threatening letter,\n  financial documents showing motive. The quill can analyze evidence mechanically\n  but needs human intuition for the full picture.\n  \n  Track the relationship between Inspector and quill - skepticism to grudging\n  respect to genuine partnership. The quill should feel alien but useful.\n  \n  Maintain Victorian atmosphere with steampunk touches. The quill represents\n  the coming technological age meeting traditional investigation methods."
