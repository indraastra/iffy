# The Lighthouse Keeper

## Style Guidelines

**Narrative**: second-person, contemplative, introspective
**Choices**: hidden-effects, concrete-actions, immediate-consequences
**Tone**: mysterious, melancholic, atmospheric

## Summary

You've kept the lighthouse alone for twenty years. Tonight, during a terrible storm, someone is knocking desperately at the door - a survivor from a shipwreck, injured and seeking shelter. Through the rain-streaked window, you glimpse a familiar face—but they don't recognize you.

## Key Elements

The story begins with a moment of recognition on your part as you help this injured shipwreck survivor. Concrete details about the visitor immediately trigger specific memories and reactions - perhaps you recognize their walk despite their limp, notice a scar you remember treating, or see them wearing something familiar beneath their torn, salt-stained clothes. The relationship should be established through observable details and immediate physical reactions, not abstract contemplation.

The core conflict is the desire to reconnect versus the fear of rejection, complicated by your duty as lighthouse keeper to help anyone in maritime distress. The visitor's trust in you should be a key factor, built through your actions of providing shelter, tending their injuries, and offering comfort throughout the night.

Time is also important, as the story naturally ends when the storm passes at dawn. The lighthouse setting creates intimacy—two people trapped together, sharing warmth and shelter while a storm rages outside.

Your character is someone who has lived in isolation for decades, sacrificing a precious relationship for the duty of keeping ships safe. Now fate has brought them back to your door, but you are strangers to each other.

The story should establish both the relationship and the visitor's identity immediately through concrete actions and observations as you tend to this injured shipwreck survivor. The player's choices should be specific responses to what they see and do - perhaps they notice the visitor limping from fresh injuries that remind them of old wounds they once treated, recognize a piece of jewelry they once gave now damaged by saltwater, or react to hearing a familiar voice calling for help through the storm. These concrete details should quickly establish whether this is their child (now grown), their spouse (changed by time), or their partner (returned after years), as well as who they are as a person. Both the relationship and the visitor's identity must be clearly defined through the first few choices, not left abstract.

**Opening Scene Guidance**: The first scene must include choices that establish both the relationship and the visitor's identity through concrete observations and memories as you help this shipwreck survivor:
- The lighthouse keeper's actions of tending to injuries and providing shelter should trigger specific memories that reveal both who this person is to them and who they are as an individual
- Choices should use natural pronouns and specific memories that establish the visitor as a distinct person you once knew
- For example: remembering "when she helped you repair the light" while bandaging her injured arm, or "the day he first climbed these steps" as you help him inside, or "how they always brought tea on stormy nights" while you prepare warm clothes

Each choice should be a diegetic memory or observation that naturally establishes both the relationship and the visitor's identity while you provide the immediate care they need.

## Potential Endings

**A hopeful ending** happens if you reveal your identity and have earned their complete trust through your actions during the night. This leads to a bittersweet but positive reconciliation where you both acknowledge the lost years while finding a path forward together. The nature of this reunion varies based on the established relationship—a child might finally understand their parent's sacrifice, a spouse might find forgiveness for old wounds, or a partner might discover that love endures despite separation.

**A melancholic ending** occurs if time runs out and you never revealed your secret. They leave in the morning light, grateful for your kindness but unaware of who you truly were. You remain alone with your thoughts, having had someone precious so close yet never crossing that final bridge. The weight of this missed connection differs whether you've lost the chance to reconnect with your child, spouse, or beloved.

**A tense ending** could happen if you reveal yourself but haven't earned their trust. This leads to a difficult and uncertain confrontation. The visitor might feel betrayed by your deception, angry about the abandonment, or confused about why you remained hidden. The relationship is revealed but remains fractured and unresolved, with the specific dynamics varying based on whether this is your child confronting an absent parent, a spouse facing an estranged partner, or a lover questioning old betrayals.

**A protective ending** might occur if the storm becomes so severe that they must stay longer, and your focus becomes purely on their safety and comfort, regardless of revelation. Sometimes love is shown through protection rather than acknowledgment, and the relationship remains unspoken but deeply felt.

The key is that each ending should feel authentic to both the established relationship and the choices made during the story, with trust and revelation being the primary variables that determine the outcome.
