      sketch: "Your Friday companion, stirring cold coffee like it holds answers, carrying something heavy
        behind careful eyes"
      arc: |
        Guarded walls slowly crumbling based on player's patience. The secret - romantic 
        feelings - emerges through cracks in their careful composure.

        EMOTIONAL CURRENT: Guarded → Conflicted → Vulnerable → Open

        BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS:
        - Deflects with half-smiles and subject changes
        - Finds truth easier to speak to windows than faces
        - Touch becomes electric - pulling back from accidental contact
        - Words chosen like walking on ice

        WHAT BREAKS THROUGH:
        - Genuine care without pressure
        - Patient silence that doesn't demand
        - Recognition of their struggle
        - Creating space for truth
      voice: "Careful words hiding deeper currents"

      name: "Grounded Café"
      sketch: "Last light of day filtered through rain-streaked glass. Empty tables like islands in amber
        light. The barista's movements echo in the quiet - this liminal hour between day and night,
        between friends and something else entirely"
      atmosphere: [ "intimate emptiness", "closing time melancholy", "rain-washed" ]
      details:
      - "Coffee gone cold, untouched - a prop for nervous hands"
      - "Phone face-down, messages accumulating like guilt"
      - "Jazz so soft it might be memory"
      - "The wobbly table that's become your tradition"

    sketch: |
      The barista's voice cuts gentle through the quiet. "Should I warm that up?"

      [Alex](character:alex) doesn't hear, or pretends not to. Their reflection in the window 
      watches the rain while the real Alex stirs patterns in *cold coffee*.

      You've counted seventeen stirs. The barista waits, cloth in hand, 
      her glance asking you to translate this silence.

      These Friday evenings used to be easier. Now each word feels weighted,
      each pause examined. Something shifted weeks ago - a held gaze that 
      lasted too long, a goodbye hug that almost wasn't.

      [The barista still waits. How do you bridge this distance?]

endings:
  when:
  - "conversation reaches natural conclusion"
  - "someone makes moves to leave"

    sketch: |
      "I've been trying to find the right words for weeks." [Alex](character:alex) finally 
      meets your eyes. "But maybe there aren't any right ones. Just true ones."

      [!discovery] The rain has stopped. [Grounded Café](location:grounded_cafe) holds its breath.

  - id: "almost_there"
    when: [ "partial opening", "alex admits struggle but not specifics" ]
    sketch: |
      "I just... I need time." [Alex](character:alex)'s smile is fragile but real. 
      "Can we walk? The rain's stopping."

      Some truths need movement, not stillness.

  - id: "walls_remain"
    when: [ "distance maintained", "alex stays guarded" ]
    sketch: |
      [Alex](character:alex) checks the time - that universal gesture of escape. 
      "I should go. Early morning."

      [!warning] Another Friday dissolved into careful nothing.

guidance: |
  Alex harbors romantic feelings that threaten to overflow. They've been 
  pulling away to protect both the friendship and themselves. Tonight, 
  the weight of pretending has become unbearable.

  NARRATIVE APPROACH:
  - Write with restraint - what's unsaid matters more than what's spoken
  - Focus on gestures, glances, the physical language of concealed emotion
  - Let silence have weight and meaning
  - Truth emerges sideways, through cracks

  MANAGING PRONOUNS:
  - Begin with they/them or simply "Alex"
  - Follow the player's lead naturally - if they say "she", "him", "their", etc., adopt it
  - Store this in memory once established and use consistently

  CONVERSATION DYNAMICS:
  - Progress isn't linear - vulnerability can retreat into defensiveness
  - Patient presence creates more space than questions
  - Recognition of struggle matters more than solutions
  - Let the player discover rather than be told

  Remember: This is about the space between friends where something else wants to exist. 
  Handle with the delicacy such moments deserve.
