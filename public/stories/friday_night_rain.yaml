      Friday evening settles around your corner table like a familiar weight. The 
      rain outside turns café windows into moving watercolors of city lights. 
      Alex sits across from you, something unspoken weighing in the space between.

      These Friday evenings used to be easier. Now each word feels weighted,
      each pause examined. Something shifted weeks ago - a held gaze that 
      lasted too long, a goodbye hug that almost wasn't.

      The barista's voice cuts gentle through the quiet. "Should I warm that up?"

      [Alex](character:alex) doesn't hear, or pretends not to. Their reflection in the window 
      watches the rain while the real Alex stirs patterns in *cold coffee*.

      You've counted seventeen stirs. The barista waits, cloth in hand, 
      her glance asking you to translate this silence.

      The silence stretches between you, heavier than before. Some walls are built 
      too strong to tear down in a single evening.

guidance: |
  STORY TONE: This is an intimate, realistic conversation between close friends where one is hiding something important. Focus on subtle emotional cues, meaningful silences, and the gradual building of trust.

  THE SECRET:
  Alex has developed romantic feelings for the player but is terrified of ruining their friendship. They've been pulling away to protect themselves and the relationship, but it's making everything worse. This is why they've been distant lately.

  NARRATIVE APPROACH:
  - Write with restraint - what's unsaid matters more than what's spoken
  - Focus on gestures, glances, the physical language of concealed emotion
  - Let silence have weight and meaning
  - Include natural hesitations, incomplete sentences, and meaningful silences
  - Show emotions through actions: stirring coffee, looking away, fidgeting

  MANAGING PRONOUNS:
  - Begin with they/them or simply "Alex"
  - Follow the player's lead naturally - if they say "she", "him", "their", etc., adopt it
  - Store this in memory once established and use consistently
