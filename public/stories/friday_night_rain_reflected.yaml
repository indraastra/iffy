      Friday evening settles around your corner table like a familiar weight. The 
      rain outside turns café windows into moving watercolors of city lights. 
      Jordan sits across from you, something unspoken weighing in the space between.

      These Friday evenings used to be easier. Now each silence feels examined, 
      each glance measured. Something shifted weeks ago - words that wanted to be 
      spoken but stayed trapped behind careful politeness.

      [Jordan](character:jordan) slides a book across the table. "Found this at that 
      place on Elm. All those parallel universe stories you mentioned last week."

      The rain outside draws patterns. The barista starts the end-of-shift ritual. 
      Your coffee has gone cold but your hands need something to hold. Jordan watches
      with that particular stillness that means they're giving you space to exist.

    guidance: |
      CORE MECHANIC: The player provides thoughts. You convert these 
      into actions - sometimes direct, often deflected through anxious behaviors.

      JORDAN'S RESPONSES:
      - Notices physical cues: "You okay? You're doing that thing with the sugar packets"
      - Fills silence with gentle talk
      - Shares their own vulnerabilities if seeing signs of opening up

      CONFESSION HANDLING:
      - If romantic feelings are expressed, let the conversation continue naturally
      - Don't rush to ending - let both characters sit with the new reality
      - Environmental cues (barista stacking chairs, lights dimming) signal when it's time to leave

      PROGRESSION:
      - Early thoughts tend toward anxious actions (fidgeting, looking away)
      - As Jordan creates safety, thoughts might translate more directly
      - Track comfort level through how directly thoughts become actions
      - The closer to speaking truth, the more actions align with thoughts

      ENVIRONMENTAL REACTIONS:
      - Rain intensity might mirror internal state
      - Barista's presence provides natural interruptions
      - Coffee temperature marks time passing
      - Background jazz ebbs and flows with emotional intensity

endings:
  when:
  - "player leaves the cafe"

  variations:
  - id: "connection"
    when: "romantic feelings have been mutually expressed and acknowledged"

      "So," [Jordan](character:jordan) says eventually, their hand still holding 
      yours across the table. "What happens now?"

      The barista is stacking chairs. The rain has softened to mist. You both 
      know it's time to leave, but neither moves first.

      "Walk me home?" Jordan asks. "We can figure out the rest as we go."

      You stand together, gathering books and coats. Everything has changed. 
      Nothing has changed. Both things are beautifully true.

      [!discovery] The bell chimes your exit into a world of new possibilities.

  - id: "friendship"
    when: "romantic feelings were expressed but friendship was chosen"
    sketch: |
      The conversation has found its landing place. Not where you hoped, but 
      somewhere solid and true.

      "Next Friday?" [Jordan](character:jordan) asks as you both prepare to leave. 
      "Same time, same table?"

      "Wouldn't miss it," you manage. And you mean it. Some friendships are 
      worth more than the possibilities they close.

      The rain has stopped. The walk to the door feels both heavy and light. 
      Jordan hugs you at the threshold - careful, caring, exactly what you 
      both need.

  - id: "missed_chance"
    when: "romantic feelings were never explicitly voiced"
    sketch: |
      "I should go," you say. The words come easier than the ones that matter.

      [Jordan](character:jordan) nods, gathering their things. They slide the 
      book across to you one more time. "Keep this. The chapter on parallel 
      universes especially."

      At the door, they pause. "Hey. Whatever you couldn't say tonight... 
      I'll still be here next Friday. And the Friday after that."

      The bell chimes your exit. Behind you, Jordan watches through the rain-
      streaked glass. Some words need more time to find their way.

  CRITICAL - PRONOUN HANDLING:
  - Current pronouns for Jordan: {jordan_pronouns} (check flag value)
  - Listen for how player refers to Jordan in their thoughts/actions:
    * "I think she's..." → Set jordan_pronouns="she"
    * "He looks patient" → Set jordan_pronouns="he" 
    * "Tell them..." → Keep jordan_pronouns="they"
  - Once established, use consistently throughout your response
  - Update via: flagChanges: { values: { jordan_pronouns: "she" } }

  CORE CONCEPT: The gap between thought and action IS the story. Jordan responds 
  to behaviors, not thoughts (which only the player and narrator know).
