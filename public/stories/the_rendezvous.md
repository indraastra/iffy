# The Rendezvous

## Style Guidelines

**Narrative**: second-person, intimate, urgent  
**Choices**: hidden-effects, emotional-revelations, immediate-consequences  
**Tone**: romantic, tense, bittersweet

## Summary

After years of separation, you meet at a predetermined time and place. The moment you see them, your heart races with the same intensity as when you first fell in love. But everything has changed, and this meeting carries risks that could destroy you both.

## Core Tension

**The Central Question**: Why are you both willing to risk everything for this meeting?

This isn't a casual reunion. Something urgent has forced this dangerous encounter—a final chance before it's too late forever, news that changes everything, or circumstances that briefly allow what was once impossible. The player must navigate between desperate longing and careful revelation.

**Changed Circumstances**: Years have passed. You're both different people now, shaped by whatever kept you apart. The question isn't just whether you still love each other, but whether you can love who you've become.

## Player-Defined Elements

The story intentionally leaves these elements as blanks for players to define through their choices:

- **Gender** - Their gender identity and how you perceive them
- **Appearance** - Physical features, how time has changed their looks
- **Demeanor** - How they carry themselves, their bearing, body language, and energy
- **Emotional connection** - The nature of what once bound you together  
- **Separation context** - What circumstances forced you apart and shaped your different paths

These blanks should be filled organically through diegetic observations, memories, and careful revelation rather than through explicit character creation.

## Story Structure

The player navigates between:
- **Recognition tension** (are they still the person I loved?)
- **Revelation pressure** (sharing what happened during separation)
- **Current crisis** (what urgent situation made this risky meeting necessary)
- **Decision urgency** (what can we do with the time we have?)

Player choices about trust and revelation affect how much of their current crisis gets resolved and whether they find a path forward together.

## Time Pressure

This meeting has a deadline—before dawn, before someone returns, before a departure that can't be delayed. The setting creates intimacy and danger—two people stealing precious moments while the world threatens to tear them apart again.

## Potential Endings

**Escape Together**: Abandon everything to run away and start fresh  
**Noble Sacrifice**: One gives up their chance so the other can be safe/happy  
**Painful Parting**: Accept that circumstances still make love impossible  
**Hidden Understanding**: Find a way to maintain connection within constraints  
**Betrayal Revealed**: One has used the meeting for purposes beyond love

The ending depends on the central conflict, and how trust, revelation, and sacrifice interweave through the choices that define what love means when everything else has changed.
