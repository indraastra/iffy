    sketch: |
      Track Nine Café, 6:30 PM. Through the windows, your train waits on Platform 3.
      The departure board clicks: **8:47 - OVERNIGHT EXPRESS - ON TIME**

      [Mia](character:mia) drops into the seat across from you. "Two hours to talk you 
      out of this crazy plan." She's grinning, but there's something else in her eyes.

      Your packed backpack leans against the table. In the corner, a vintage jukebox 
      cycles through warm lights.

      [Sam](character:sam) approaches with the coffee pot. "Refills? Or maybe some music 
      to set the mood?" They nod toward the Wurlitzer. "Track 9s have a way of revealing 
      what needs revealing."

    guidance: |
      SCENE ENTRY: Reset music_selected=false when entering this scene (allows jukebox re-use).

      INTERACTIONS: This is the main conversation space. Player can talk to Mia about 
      the journey, engage with Sam about coffee/life wisdom, or show interest in the jukebox.

      JUKEBOX TRIGGER: Set jukebox_approached=true when player shows interest in music/jukebox 
      (approaching it, asking about it, mentioning music, etc.)

    transitions:
      jukebox:
        requires:

  jukebox:
    sketch: |
      You approach the vintage Wurlitzer, quarters in hand. The handwritten sign reads: 
      "Only plays track 9 from any album - Sam's Rules."

      The selection wheel shows various albums from different eras:

      **Available selections:**
      - Yeah Yeah Yeahs - *Maps*
      - The Cure - *Just Like Heaven*
      - Bob Marley - *Three Little Birds*
      - Radiohead - *Jigsaw Falling into Place*
      - Tool - *Lateralus*

      Mia watches from the table. "Good choice on the track 9 rule. Sometimes 
      you need the universe to narrow down your options."

    guidance: |
      SCENE ENTRY: Reset jukebox_approached=false when entering this scene (clean interaction).

      MUSIC SELECTION: When player selects a song, set music_selected=true and describe 
      the music starting to play. Each song should create a different mood for the 
      conversation when they return to the opening scene.

      SCENE PURPOSE: This is a focused interaction - player chooses music and returns 
      to the main conversation with the selected mood enhancement.

      "I'm not getting on that train," you say, surprised by your own certainty.

      Mia's face transforms with hope. Through the window, the overnight express 
      pulls away from Platform 3, carrying other people's journeys into the night.

      "Are you sure?" she asks. "I don't want to be the reason you don't heal."

      You reach across and take her hand. "Maybe healing doesn't always mean 
      going away. Maybe sometimes it means staying and building something new."

      Sam appears with fresh coffee. "Next train's not for another week. Gives 
      you time to figure things out."

      Mia's eyes widen. "I can't just... I have work, responsibilities..."

      "So did I. The ticket office is still open. What if healing doesn't mean 
      doing it alone? What if it means doing it with someone who loves you?"

      Sam, eavesdropping shamelessly, pipes up: "Forty-five minutes till they 
      close. Just saying."

      The final boarding call echoes through the station. You stand, backpack 
      in hand, everything you wanted to say stuck in your throat.

      Mia manages a brave smile. "Send me postcards?"

      "Every town," you promise.

      As you head for the stairs, Sam calls out: "Sometimes the journey teaches 
      us what home really means."

      Through the café window, you see Mia watching as your train pulls away 
      into the night.

guidance: |
  CRITICAL - CHARACTER CONSISTENCY:
  - Mia is female (she/her pronouns)
  - The player/main character is male
  - Sam is the server (they/them or context-appropriate pronouns)

  TONE AND PACING:
  - More energetic and conversational than contemplative stories
  - Real-time conversation, not literary introspection
  - The two-hour countdown creates urgency
  - Allow natural interruptions and momentum shifts

  EMERGENT STORYTELLING:
  - Don't force specific paths - let player actions guide the narrative
  - Sam can appear whenever it feels natural
  - The jukebox music should color the mood but not dictate it
  - Mia's confession can happen early, late, or be prompted by player
  - Other café patrons and station activity provide texture

  CONVERSATION STYLE:
  - Quick exchanges, incomplete sentences, talking over each other
  - Nervous energy, deflection, sudden vulnerable moments
  - Less "weight of silence" and more "filling silence with chatter"
  - Friends who know each other's rhythms

  TIME PROGRESSION:
  - Story starts at 6:30 PM
  - Train departs at 8:47 PM
  - Let time advance naturally through scenes
  - Boarding announcements at 7:00, 7:30, 8:00, 8:30
  - Each announcement should increase urgency
