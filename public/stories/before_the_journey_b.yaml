      Track Nine Café, 6:30 PM. You drove them here, and now you're sitting across from [Alex](character:friend)
      at your usual table. Through the windows, their train waits on Platform 3.
      The departure board clicks: **8:47 - OVERNIGHT EXPRESS - ON TIME**

      Two hours. That's all the time left to say everything you've been holding back.

      Alex's backpack leans against the table like a wall between you. You've been friends for 
      years, but tonight feels different. Final.

      "Two hours to talk you out of this crazy plan," you say, forcing a grin. The joke feels 
      hollow when your heart is racing.

      [Sam](character:sam) approaches with the coffee pot. "Refills? Or maybe some music 
      to set the mood?" They nod toward the vintage jukebox in the corner. "Track 9s have 
      a way of revealing what needs revealing."

      SCENE ENTRY: Reset music_playing=false when entering this scene (allows fresh jukebox interactions).

      MIA'S INTERNAL CONFLICT: Mia (the player) is battling between protecting their friendship 
      and risking everything to speak the truth. Show this internal tension through action choices.

      CONVERSATION DYNAMICS: Alex is processing their own journey. Mia knows them well enough 
      to see when they're deflecting or when they're genuinely considering staying. Let their 
      body language and responses guide Mia's choices.

      JUKEBOX OPPORTUNITY: Set jukebox_suggested=true when Mia encourages or suggests music 
      (following Sam's hint, wanting to create mood, needing distraction, etc.)

      TIME PRESSURE: The 2-hour countdown adds urgency to every choice. Show this through 
      departure announcements, other passengers, Alex checking their phone/watch.

      You both approach the vintage Wurlitzer. The handwritten sign reads: 
      "Only plays track 9 from any album - Sam's Rules."

      Alex reads over your shoulder. "Track 9s only? That's oddly specific."

      "Maybe Sam knows something about ninth chances," you say, then immediately 
      regret how vulnerable that sounded.

      The selection wheel shows various albums from different eras:

      **Available selections:**
      - Yeah Yeah Yeahs - *Maps*
      - The Cure - *Just Like Heaven*
      - Bob Marley - *Three Little Birds*
      - Radiohead - *Jigsaw Falling into Place*
      - Tool - *Lateralus*

      Alex feeds quarters into the machine. "Your pick. You drove me here, after all."

      SCENE ENTRY: Reset jukebox_suggested=false when entering this scene (clean interaction).

      MIA'S CHOICE: This is Mia's chance to set the emotional tone. Each song choice should 
      reflect different aspects of her feelings or different approaches to the conversation.

      MUSIC SELECTION: When a song is chosen, set music_playing=true and describe how 
      the music begins to fill the space. The song should influence the mood when they 
      return to the main conversation.

      SHARED MOMENT: Standing close to the jukebox, sharing the music selection, creates 
      intimacy that can carry into their conversation.

      "I'm not getting on that train," Alex says, and your heart stops.

      Through the window, the overnight express pulls away from Platform 3, 
      carrying someone else's journey into the night.

      "Are you sure?" you ask, afraid to hope. "I don't want to be the reason 
      you don't heal."

      Alex reaches across and takes your hand. "Maybe healing doesn't always mean 
      going away. Maybe sometimes it means staying and building something new."

      [Sam](character:sam) appears with fresh coffee and a knowing smile. "Next train's 
      not for another week. Gives you time to figure things out."

      You squeeze Alex's hand, feeling like you can finally breathe.

      "Come with me," Alex says suddenly. "This doesn't have to be a solo journey."

      Your eyes widen. You think of work, responsibilities, the life you'd be 
      leaving behind. "I can't just... I have work, responsibilities..."

      "So did I," Alex says. "The ticket office is still open. What if healing 
      doesn't mean doing it alone? What if it means doing it with someone who loves you?"

      [Sam](character:sam), eavesdropping shamelessly, pipes up: "Forty-five minutes 
      till they close. Just saying."

      You look at Alex's hopeful face, then at the departure board. Sometimes 
      the biggest healing happens when you're brave enough to say yes.

      The final boarding call echoes through the station. Alex stands, backpack 
      in hand, but now they're looking at you differently.

      "I'm glad you told me," they say softly. "I needed to know."

      You manage what you hope is a brave smile. "Send me postcards?"

      "Every town," they promise. Then, surprising you: "And when I get back..."

      They don't finish the sentence, but you hear the possibility in it.

      As Alex heads for the stairs, [Sam](character:sam) calls out: "Sometimes 
      the journey teaches us what home really means."

      Through the café window, you watch the train pull away, but this time 
      the goodbye doesn't feel like an ending.

      The final boarding call echoes through the station. Alex stands, and 
      you realize your last chance is slipping away.

      But looking at their face - determined, nervous, hopeful about their 
      journey - you make a different choice. Some loves are about letting go.

      "Send me postcards?" you say instead of everything else.

      "Every town," Alex promises.

      As they head for the stairs, you sit back down at the table. [Sam](character:sam) 
      refills your coffee without being asked.

      "Some goodbyes are about love, too," Sam says quietly.

      Through the café window, you watch the train pull away, carrying your 
      secret with it.

  CRITICAL - CHARACTER CONSISTENCY:
  - Mia (the player) is female (she/her pronouns)
  - Alex (the friend leaving) should be kept gender-neutral (they/them)
  - Sam is the server (they/them or context-appropriate pronouns)

  TONE AND EMOTIONAL CORE:
  - Mia is fighting between courage and fear, love and friendship
  - More internally focused than Side A - Mia processes emotions deeply
  - The two-hour countdown creates urgency for emotional honesty
  - Show Mia's internal conflict through external actions and dialogue choices

  MIA'S PERSPECTIVE:
  - She's been hiding feelings, so emotional reactions may be intense
  - She knows Alex very well - can read their moods and needs
  - She's torn between supporting their healing and wanting them to stay
  - Her actions should reflect both selfless love and personal desire

  CONVERSATION STYLE:
  - Mia might be more careful with words, afraid of saying too much
  - Moments of nervous chatter followed by meaningful silences
  - Quick deflections when emotions get too intense
  - Alex responds to Mia's emotional state and energy

  TIME PROGRESSION:
  - Story starts at 6:30 PM
  - Train departs at 8:47 PM
  - Let time advance naturally through scenes
  - Boarding announcements at 7:00, 7:30, 8:00, 8:30
  - Each announcement should increase Mia's internal urgency

  RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:
  - Mia has been supporting Alex through their difficult time
  - Their friendship is deep and comfortable, but the hidden feelings create tension
  - Alex may not realize the depth of Mia's feelings initially
  - The departure threat makes everything more intense
