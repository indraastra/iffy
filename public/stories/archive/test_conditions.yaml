      Track which buttons have been pressed and set the appropriate flags:
      - Set "button1_pressed" when player presses red button (1)
      - Set "button2_pressed" when player presses blue button (2) 
      - Set "button3_pressed" when player presses green button (3)
      - Set "confirm_pressed" when player presses CONFIRM
      
      Display the current sequence in your responses.
