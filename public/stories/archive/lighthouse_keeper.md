# The Lighthouse Keeper

## Style Guidelines

**Narrative**: second-person, contemplative, introspective  
**Choices**: hidden-effects, concrete-actions, immediate-consequences  
**Tone**: mysterious, melancholic, atmospheric

## Summary

You've kept the lighthouse alone for twenty years. Tonight, during a terrible storm, someone is knocking desperately at the door - someone from your past, injured and seeking shelter. You recognize them immediately, but their reaction to you is unclear.

## Core Tension

**The Central Question**: Why are they here now, after all these years?

Their arrival isn't coincidence. They're fleeing something, seeking something, or driven by urgent circumstances. The player must decide whether to press for recognition or let them maintain whatever distance they're keeping, and these choices affect how the crisis that brought them here gets revealed.

**Recognition Ambiguity**: The visitor might recognize you, might have amnesia, might be pretending ignorance, or might be purposely avoiding the past. The player doesn't know which, and their approach to this uncertainty drives the story.

## Player-Defined Elements

The story intentionally leaves these elements as blanks for players to define through their choices:

1. **Visitor's gender** - their gender identity and how you perceive them
2. **Visitor's appearance** - physical features, visible signs of their journey
3. **Visitor's demeanor** - how they carry themselves, their emotional state, body language
4. **Visitor's voice** - tone, accent, familiarity, what it reveals about their identity
5. **Relationship type** - child, spouse, or partner through shared memories  
6. **Crisis nature** - signs of what urgent situation brought them here

These blanks should be filled organically through diegetic observations and memories rather than explicit character creation.

## Story Structure

The player navigates between:
- **Immediate care** (tending injuries, providing shelter)
- **Recognition tension** (do they know me? should I reveal myself?)
- **Crisis mystery** (what brought them here? what are they running from/toward?)

Player choices about pressing for recognition vs. maintaining distance affect how much of the visitor's crisis gets revealed and resolved.

## Time Pressure

The storm ends at dawn. The lighthouse setting creates intimacyâ€”two people trapped together through one night, with unresolved history and an urgent mystery.

## Potential Endings

**Hopeful Reunion**: Identity revealed, trust earned, crisis resolved together  
**Melancholic Parting**: They leave unaware, crisis unresolved, connection missed  
**Tense Confrontation**: Identity revealed but trust damaged, crisis complicated  
**Protective Focus**: Crisis resolved through care, identity remains unspoken  

The ending depends on how recognition and crisis revelation interweave through player choices.
