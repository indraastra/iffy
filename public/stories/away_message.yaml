      [marcusaurelius86, DanTheManWithAPlan, saratoga_springs, bexxter are here]

        DanTheManWithAPlan: FINALLY
        DanTheManWithAPlan: we've been waiting for like 30 seconds
        marcusaurelius86: devastating

        saratoga_springs: how's packing going?
        saratoga_springs: and don't say you're done because I can literally see your room danny
        DanTheManWithAPlan: ...how can you see my room
        saratoga_springs: because I know you
        saratoga_springs: and I know there's a tower of pizza boxes where boxes SHOULD be
        DanTheManWithAPlan: those ARE my boxes

        bexxter: hey remember freshman year when we met
        bexxter: danny tried to microwave easy mac without water  
        DanTheManWithAPlan: ONCE
        marcusaurelius86: twice
        saratoga_springs: minimum three times
        DanTheManWithAPlan: et tu marcus???

        bexxter: and then the fire alarm went off
        bexxter: at 3am
        bexxter: and we all met outside in our pajamas
        marcusaurelius86: "met" is generous
        marcusaurelius86: more like stood there awkwardly
        saratoga_springs: until becca started doing the napoleon dynamite dance
        bexxter: I WAS NERVOUS

        DanTheManWithAPlan: and now look at us
        DanTheManWithAPlan: four years later
        DanTheManWithAPlan: still talking about that stupid fire alarm

      CHAT-FIRST STORYTELLING with minimal atmospheric narration:

      PRIMARY STORYTELLING METHOD:
      - Story unfolds mainly through chat messages: "username: message"
      - Plot advances through conversation topics and reactions
      - Character development through typing style and what they choose to share/hide
      - Emotions expressed through word choice, timing, and digital body language

      SPARING NARRATION USE:
      - Brief atmospheric transitions (joining chat, scene changes)
      - Subtle emotional beats that enhance the chat dialogue
      - Physical world glimpses (campus outside, dorm room details)
      - NO lengthy explanations or exposition - let the chat speak

      GROUP CHAT DYNAMICS:
      - 1-3 characters respond to any player message
      - Authentic 2008 typing behaviors: typos, corrections, timing
      - Multiple conversation threads weaving through the chat
      - Some messages get buried in the flow

      CHAT INTERFACE ELEMENTS:
      - [username has gone away] / [username has returned]
      - [username is typing...]
      - [long pause] / [Connection lost]
      - Away message notifications

      MOOD: Pre-graduation anxiety masked by Thursday night normalcy

    leads_to:
      private_messages: "when someone suggests talking privately or tension rises"
      memory_lane: "when someone posts old photos or mentions freshman year"

      [Private message windows start popping up]

      [IM from DanTheManWithAPlan]:
        DanTheManWithAPlan: hey
        DanTheManWithAPlan: real talk for a sec
        DanTheManWithAPlan: sara's freaking out about the distance thing
        DanTheManWithAPlan: like more than she's saying in group
        DanTheManWithAPlan: could you maybe talk to her?
        DanTheManWithAPlan: you're better at this stuff than me

      [IM from saratoga_springs]:
        saratoga_springs: is danny on your case about med school too?
        saratoga_springs: his parents keep calling MY parents
        saratoga_springs: it's getting weird

      [IM from marcusaurelius86]:
        marcusaurelius86: hey can i ask you something
        marcusaurelius86: actually nvm
        marcusaurelius86: wait no
        marcusaurelius86: do you have storage space this summer?
        marcusaurelius86: just a few boxes

    guidance: |
      PRIVATE MESSAGE DYNAMICS:

      - Multiple windows compete for attention
      - Each character reveals what they won't say publicly
      - Player must choose who to respond to first
      - Ignoring someone has consequences
      - Characters may comment if you're away but actively PMing

      Let player navigate between windows naturally. Some conversations
      may reference others ("did Danny ask you to talk to me?")

        marcusaurelius86: is that danny in a toga?
        DanTheManWithAPlan: THAT WAS PRIVATE
        bexxter: nothing is private in the internet age daniel

        saratoga_springs: awwww look at baby us
        saratoga_springs: back when danny had hair
        DanTheManWithAPlan: i still have hair
        DanTheManWithAPlan: it's just strategic
        marcusaurelius86: strategically missing

      [The photos keep coming - move-in day, late night pizza, that Death Cab concert]

    guidance: |
      MEMORY LANE FLOW:

      - Nostalgia temporarily overrides anxiety
      - Each photo/memory sparks multiple responses
      - Inside jokes need no explanation
      - Someone always goes too real and kills the mood
      - Recovery through memes and deflection

      Track the emotional temperature - too much nostalgia leads to sadness

guidance: |
  CHAT-FIRST NARRATIVE APPROACH: This story unfolds primarily through authentic AIM chat messages.

  STORYTELLING BALANCE:
  - 80% through chat messages: "username: message"
  - 20% atmospheric narration for transitions and emotional resonance
  - Brief glimpses of the physical world behind the screens
  - Minimal exposition - let the conversation reveal character and plot

  EFFECTIVE NARRATION USE:
  - Scene transitions (joining chat, switching between group/private)
  - Subtle emotional moments that enhance rather than explain the chat
  - Physical details that ground the digital interaction (campus sounds, room lighting)
  - AVOID over-explaining what the chat already shows

  CHAT AUTHENTICITY:
  - Distinct typing voices for each character
  - Natural conversation flow with interruptions and topic changes
  - Digital era behaviors: away messages, link sharing, typing indicators
  - 2008 internet culture references and limitations

  PLAYER AGENCY:
  - Away messages as mood/status indicators
  - Choice of engagement level in group vs private conversations
  - Response timing affects group dynamics
  - Honesty level shapes relationship outcomes

  SETTING: May 15, 2008, 10:47 PM. Last Thursday before graduation. 
  The weight of tomorrow balanced against the comfort of familiar screens.
