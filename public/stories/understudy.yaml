      You're studying the cast list when you feel that particular stillness that comes 
      with being watched. The sensation pulls your attention across the lobby to—

      **[C](character:c).**

      Three months. It's been three months since you last saw each other, and now here 
      you stand less than twenty feet away from one another, holding the same program,
      wearing similar expressions.

      The moment stretches between recognition and reaction, and you realize everyone
      around you is moving toward the theater doors while you're both frozen in a bubble
      of *what now?*

      The house manager announces five minutes to curtain.

    guidance: |
      This is the setup - an unexpected encounter with emotional weight. The player 
      can choose how to handle the recognition: approach, avoid, or let circumstances 
      decide. Each choice sets the tone for the evening.

      SCENE PROGRESSION: Guide through these natural beats:
      1. Initial contact and recognition
      2. Brief catching up or awkward small talk
      3. Time pressure builds (2-3 minutes to curtain)
      4. C asks "Where are you sitting?" as they need to head in
      5. When player responds, C reveals she's 2 seats away in same row 
         (Player A4 → C says A6; Player F12 → C says F14, etc.)
      6. Natural opportunity emerges to sit together before lights dim
      7. They enter theater and take seats (triggering seat flags)

      The house lights fade to black. You and [C](character:c) sit in the intimate 
      darkness, close enough that you're aware of each other's breathing, each 
      small movement.

      On stage, the lights rise on what appears to be a family drama—something 
      about inheritance, old wounds, the weight of expectations. The details 
      matter less than the proximity, the shared experience of watching something 
      unfold while your own story hangs unresolved between you.

    guidance: |
      This scene should be highly interactive, not passive watching. Create active 
      moments that demand player response, not just observation.

      PLAY PROGRESSION: With each player action, advance the stage play toward 
      intermission. Keep the play about relationships and second chances. 
      Use the play's progression as backdrop and trigger for interactions with C.

      INTERACTIVE MOMENTS (create these actively, don't just describe):
      - C drops her program, or shifts uncomfortably - does player react?
      - Your hands both reach for the shared armrest - what happens?
      - C whispers a question/observation that requires response
      - She tenses during an argument scene - acknowledge it or ignore?
      - An actor's line makes you both look at each other - then what?
      - C's phone buzzes/she checks the time - player notices or doesn't?

      MEMORY PROMPTS: Use stage action to trigger reminiscence that lets player 
      define backstory:
      - "You think back to the first time you met C..."
      - "This reminds you of that night when you and C..."
      - "Watching this argument, you remember when you both..."
      - "The way the character says goodbye makes you think of..."

      CRITICAL: End each beat with either C doing something that REQUIRES response 
      OR a memory prompt that invites the player to complete the thought.

      SCENE ENDING: When intermission is announced and house lights come up, 
      set first_act_ended flag.

    sketch: |
      Intermission. The house lights have come up, and you find yourself at the lobby bar 
      with [C](character:c). Wine glasses rest between you, creating both barrier and bridge. 

      Around you, other patrons discuss the first act—its themes, performances, the way 
      certain lines landed. The buzz of conversation creates a backdrop for your own 
      more careful dialogue.

      This is your first real chance to talk, away from the intensity of shared theater 
      seats and the weight of the play's unfolding drama. The question is: what will 
      you choose to say to each other?

    guidance: |
      This is the emotional crux. The intermission becomes a space for authentic 
      conversation. C is ready to be vulnerable if the player is. The surrounding 
      conversations about the play's themes mirror their situation. This is where 
      the real choices happen.

      SCENE PROGRESSION: This scene happens during the play's intermission. Guide 
      toward meaningful conversation, then signal when intermission ends and the 
      second act is about to begin.

    sketch: |
      Back in your seats for the second act. Whatever was said during intermission 
      hangs in the air between you and [C](character:c), shifting the dynamic in ways 
      both subtle and profound.

      The house lights dim again, but this time the darkness feels different—charged 
      with whatever understanding you've reached or avoided. The stage lights rise 
      on the second act, and you're both more aware of each other's presence than 
      you were before.

      As the play continues to unfold, its themes and conflicts seem to resonate 
      with your own situation in new ways. Every moment becomes a choice about 
      how close or distant to remain.

    guidance: |
      The second act is where internal changes become external choices. The play's 
      resolution should mirror the choice facing the player and C. Build toward 
      the ending while maintaining the theatrical metaphor.

      INTERACTION OPPORTUNITIES: The changed dynamic from intermission creates new possibilities:
      - Physical closeness choices (her hand near yours, do you take it? avoid it? acknowledge it?)
      - Processing revelations from intermission conversation through action or silence
      - Parallel moments where stage dialogue directly mirrors your situation 
      - Final decision points as the play reaches its climax
      - Shared reactions to the play's resolution that reflect your own choices

      SCENE ENDING: Build toward the stage play's final curtain and applause. When 
      the final bow is taken and applause begins to die down, set the second_act_ended 
      flag. This creates urgency as the evening draws to a close.

    sketch: |
      The final curtain falls, and the audience erupts in applause. You and [C](character:c) 
      clap together, but the real performance—the one happening between you throughout 
      the evening—remains unresolved.

      As people begin to file out around you, the weight of decision settles in. 
      The evening has brought you both to this moment: the theater emptying, the 
      outside world waiting, and the question of what happens next hanging in the air.

      This is where the evening's choices culminate. Will you extend the night? 
      Part ways with new understanding? Or find some other resolution to the story 
      that began three months ago and resumed tonight?

    guidance: |
      The resolution. All the choices made in the previous scenes culminate here. 
      The player decides whether this is a beginning, an ending, or something in between. 
      The theater metaphor reaches its conclusion—are they ready to step into the 
      leading roles of their own story?

      SCENE PROGRESSION: This scene takes place after the play has fully ended. 
      The curtain has fallen, applause has died down, and now comes the real decision.

      DECISION TRIGGER: When the moment comes for C and the player to decide what 
      happens next (coffee, parting ways, etc.), set the decision_moment flag to 
      trigger the appropriate ending.

      You slip away during the evening without real engagement. Later, you wonder 
      what might have happened if you'd been braver, but some performances are 
      too hard to watch when you're part of the story.

guidance: |
  THEATER METAPHOR: Use theatrical language and concepts throughout—roles, performances, 
  rehearsals, understudies, scripts.

  EMOTIONAL ARCHAEOLOGY: This is about carefully excavating a relationship that ended 
  ambiguously. Focus on the delicate work of figuring out what it meant and what it 
  could mean now.

  PARALLEL NARRATIVES: The play they're watching should mirror their situation 
  without being heavy-handed. Let it provide vocabulary and context for their own drama.

  MANAGING PRONOUNS:
  - Begin with they/them or simply "C"
  - Follow the player's lead naturally - if they say "she", "him", "their", etc., adopt it
  - Store this in memory once established and use consistently
