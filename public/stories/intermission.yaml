      You're studying the cast list when that familiar sensation crawls up your spine—
      the specific gravity of being seen by someone who knows your history. You turn.

      **[C](character:c).**

      Three months of carefully arranged distance collapses instantly. The program 
      trembles slightly in your hands, the same tremor you notice in theirs. Between 
      you: twenty feet of lobby carpet that might as well be an archaeological dig 
      site, layered with everything you'd buried.

      Around you, strangers flow toward the theater doors, but you're both caught—
      artifacts suddenly exposed to light.

      The house manager's voice: "Five minutes to curtain."

    guidance: |
      This moment of recognition carries the weight of unexcavated history. The player 
      chooses how to handle this archaeological site suddenly exposed: approach and 
      begin the dig, avoid and leave it buried, or let proximity decide.

      SCENE PROGRESSION: Guide through these natural beats:
      1. Initial recognition - the moment when buried history surfaces
      2. Careful conversation, each word brushing dust from the past
      3. Time pressure builds (2-3 minutes to curtain)
      4. C asks "Where are you sitting?" - practical question carrying emotional weight
      5. When player responds, C reveals proximity (2 seats away in same row)
      6. The question of sitting together becomes about more than just seats
      7. They enter theater, beginning their excavation or preservation

    sketch: |
      The house lights fade, and darkness becomes a kind of preservation—you and 
      [C](character:c) suspended together, aware of each breath disturbing the 
      carefully maintained distance of three months.

      On stage, lights reveal a family excavating their own buried grievances—
      inheritances both material and emotional, wounds preserved in family amber. 
      You're conscious of how your own unresolved history sits between you, 
      another artifact waiting to be examined or left undisturbed.

    guidance: |
      This scene should be highly interactive, not passive watching. Create active 
      moments that demand player response, not just observation.

      PLAY PROGRESSION: With each player action, advance the stage play toward 
      intermission. Keep the play about relationships and second chances. 
      Use the play's progression as backdrop and trigger for interactions with C.

      INTERACTIVE MOMENTS (create these actively, don't just describe):
      - C drops her program, or shifts uncomfortably - does player react?
      - Your hands both reach for the shared armrest - what happens?
      - C whispers a question/observation that requires response
      - She tenses during an argument scene - acknowledge it or ignore?
      - An actor's line makes you both look at each other - then what?
      - C's phone buzzes/she checks the time - player notices or doesn't?

      MEMORY PROMPTS: Use stage action to trigger reminiscence that lets player 
      define backstory:
      - "You think back to the first time you met C..."
      - "This reminds you of that night when you and C..."
      - "Watching this argument, you remember when you both..."
      - "The way the character says goodbye makes you think of..."

      CRITICAL: End each beat with either C doing something that REQUIRES response 
      OR a memory prompt that invites the player to complete the thought.

      SCENE ENDING: When intermission is announced and house lights come up, 
      set first_act_ended flag.

  intermission:
    location: "theater_bar"
    sketch: |
      Intermission finds you at the lobby bar with [C](character:c), wine glasses 
      between you like carefully placed artifacts. Each sip seems considered, 
      measured—as if you're both archaeologists afraid of contaminating the site.

      Around you, strangers discuss the play's first act, but their conversations 
      feel distant, muffled. This is your first real chance to excavate what's 
      been buried for three months.

      The question hangs unspoken: will you carefully brush away the sediment 
      of time, or leave the past preserved as it is?

    guidance: |
      This is the emotional crux. The intermission becomes a space for authentic 
      conversation. C is ready to be vulnerable if the player is. The surrounding 
      conversations about the play's themes mirror their situation. This is where 
      the real choices happen.

      SCENE PROGRESSION: This scene happens during the play's intermission. Guide 
      toward meaningful conversation, then signal when intermission ends and the 
      second act is about to begin.

    sketch: |
      Back in your seats for the second act. Whatever was said during intermission 
      hangs in the air between you and [C](character:c), shifting the dynamic in ways 
      both subtle and profound.

      The house lights dim again, but this time the darkness feels different—charged 
      with whatever understanding you've reached or avoided. The stage lights rise 
      on the second act, and you're both more aware of each other's presence than 
      you were before.

      As the play continues to unfold, its themes and conflicts seem to resonate 
      with your own situation in new ways. Every moment becomes a choice about 
      how close or distant to remain.

    guidance: |
      The second act is where internal changes become external choices. The play's 
      resolution should mirror the choice facing the player and C. Build toward 
      the ending while maintaining the theatrical metaphor.

      INTERACTION OPPORTUNITIES: The changed dynamic from intermission creates new possibilities:
      - Physical closeness choices (her hand near yours, do you take it? avoid it? acknowledge it?)
      - Processing revelations from intermission conversation through action or silence
      - Parallel moments where stage dialogue directly mirrors your situation 
      - Final decision points as the play reaches its climax
      - Shared reactions to the play's resolution that reflect your own choices

      SCENE ENDING: Build toward the stage play's final curtain and applause. When 
      the final bow is taken and applause begins to die down, set the second_act_ended 
      flag. This creates urgency as the evening draws to a close.

    sketch: |
      The final curtain falls, and the audience erupts in applause. You and [C](character:c) 
      clap together, but the real performance—the one happening between you throughout 
      the evening—remains unresolved.

      As people begin to file out around you, the weight of decision settles in. 
      The evening has brought you both to this moment: the theater emptying, the 
      outside world waiting, and the question of what happens next hanging in the air.

      This is where the evening's choices culminate. Will you extend the night? 
      Part ways with new understanding? Or find some other resolution to the story 
      that began three months ago and resumed tonight?

    guidance: |
      The resolution. All the choices made in the previous scenes culminate here. 
      The player decides whether this is a beginning, an ending, or something in between. 
      The theater metaphor reaches its conclusion—are they ready to step into the 
      leading roles of their own story?

      SCENE PROGRESSION: This scene takes place after the play has fully ended. 
      The curtain has fallen, applause has died down, and now comes the real decision.

      DECISION TRIGGER: When the moment comes for C and the player to decide what 
      happens next (coffee, parting ways, etc.), set the decision_moment flag to 
      trigger the appropriate ending.

      Walking to the coffee shop, you both carry yourselves differently—lighter, 
      like archaeologists who've finally understood what they've been excavating. 
      The past three months weren't wasted time but necessary sediment, preserving 
      what needed to be preserved until you were both ready to unearth it.

      Outside the theater, you part with the particular weight of examined history. 
      Some artifacts are meant to be catalogued and carefully returned to storage—

      there's peace in that understanding.

      The conversation at the bar was enough—fifteen minutes of careful excavation 
      that explained three months of buried silence. Sometimes the dig site yields 
      its secrets quickly, completely, leaving nothing more to uncover.

      You leave without excavating anything, both of you preserving the careful 
      burial of three months ago. Some sites aren't ready to be disturbed. Some 
      artifacts are too fragile for the light. The sediment remains undisturbed, 
      and perhaps that's its own kind of preservation.

guidance: |
  MEMORY AS ARCHAEOLOGY: Focus on physical and sensory details that unlock the past.
  Each gesture, object, or scent carries emotional sediment. Treat memories like 
  artifacts being carefully unearthed.

  EMOTIONAL EXCAVATION: This relationship ended ambiguously, leaving layers of 
  unprocessed feeling. Each interaction brushes away dust, revealing what was 
  buried—sometimes intact, sometimes broken, always significant.

  THE PLAY AS MIRROR: The play they watch reflects their situation through 
  emotional resonance, not theatrical metaphor. They're observers finding their 
  own story reflected back.

  MANAGING PRONOUNS:
  - Begin with they/them or simply "C"
  - Follow the player's lead naturally - if they say "she", "him", "their", etc., adopt it
  - Store this in memory once established and use consistently
