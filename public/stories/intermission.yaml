      You're studying the cast list when that familiar sensation crawls up your spine—
      the specific gravity of being seen by someone who knows your history. You turn.

      **[C](character:c).**

      Three months of carefully arranged distance collapses instantly. The program 
      trembles slightly in your hands, the same tremor you notice in theirs. Between 
      you: twenty feet of lobby carpet that feels impossibly vast, weighted with 
      everything left unfinished.

      Around you, strangers flow toward the theater doors, but you're both caught—
      suspended in this unexpected moment of recognition.

      The house manager's voice: "Five minutes to curtain."

    guidance: |
      This moment of recognition carries the weight of unfinished business. The player 
      chooses how to handle this unexpected encounter: approach and acknowledge 
      the past, avoid and maintain distance, or let proximity decide.

      SCENE PROGRESSION: Guide through these natural beats:
      1. Initial recognition - the moment when past meets present
      2. Careful conversation, navigating around what went unsaid
      3. Time pressure builds (2-3 minutes to curtain)
      4. C asks "Where are you sitting?" - practical question carrying emotional weight
      5. When player responds, C reveals proximity (2 seats away in same row)
      6. The question of sitting together becomes about more than just seats
      7. They enter theater, beginning their excavation or preservation

      The house lights fade, and darkness becomes a kind of permission—you and 
      [C](character:c) sitting close enough to feel each other's presence, aware 
      of each breath in the carefully maintained distance.

      On stage, lights reveal a family confronting their own unspoken truths—
      inheritances both material and emotional, old wounds still tender to touch. 
      You're conscious of how your own unresolved history sits between you, 
      waiting to be acknowledged or ignored.

    guidance: |
      This scene should be highly interactive, not passive watching. Create active 
      moments that demand player response, not just observation.

      PLAY PROGRESSION: With each player action, advance the stage play toward 
      intermission. Keep the play about relationships and second chances. 
      Use the play's progression as backdrop and trigger for interactions with C.

      INTERACTIVE MOMENTS (create these actively, don't just describe):
      - C drops her program, or shifts uncomfortably - does player react?
      - Your hands both reach for the shared armrest - what happens?
      - C whispers a question/observation that requires response
      - She tenses during an argument scene - acknowledge it or ignore?
      - An actor's line makes you both look at each other - then what?
      - C's phone buzzes/she checks the time - player notices or doesn't?

      MEMORY PROMPTS: Use stage action to trigger reminiscence that lets player 
      define backstory:
      - "You think back to the first time you met C..."
      - "This reminds you of that night when you and C..."
      - "Watching this argument, you remember when you both..."
      - "The way the character says goodbye makes you think of..."

      CRITICAL: End each beat with either C doing something that REQUIRES response 
      OR a memory prompt that invites the player to complete the thought.

      SCENE ENDING: When intermission is announced and house lights come up, 
      set first_act_ended flag.

  intermission:

    sketch: |
      Intermission finds you at the lobby bar with [C](character:c), wine glasses 
      between you like a fragile truce. Each sip seems considered, measured—as if 
      you're both testing how much honesty this moment can hold.

      Around you, strangers discuss the play's first act, but their conversations 
      feel distant, muffled. This is your first real chance to address what's 
      been unspoken for three months.

      The question hangs between you: will you finally have the conversation 
      that's been waiting, or let the past remain in the past?

    guidance: |
      This is the emotional crux. The intermission becomes a space for authentic 
      conversation. C is ready to be vulnerable if the player is. The surrounding 
      conversations about the play's themes mirror their situation. This is where 
      the real choices happen.

      SCENE PROGRESSION: This scene happens during the play's intermission. Guide 
      toward meaningful conversation, then signal when intermission ends and the 
      second act is about to begin.

    location: "theater_seats"
    sketch: |
      Back in your seats for the second act. Whatever was said during intermission 
      hangs in the air between you and [C](character:c), shifting the dynamic in ways 
      both subtle and profound.

      The house lights dim again, but this time the darkness feels different—charged 
      with whatever understanding you've reached or avoided. The stage lights rise 
      on the second act, and you're both more aware of each other's presence than 
      you were before.

      As the play continues to unfold, its themes and conflicts seem to resonate 
      with your own situation in new ways. Every moment becomes a choice about 
      how close or distant to remain.

    guidance: |
      The second act is where internal changes become external choices. The play's 
      resolution should mirror the choice facing the player and C. Build toward 
      the ending while maintaining the theatrical metaphor.

      INTERACTION OPPORTUNITIES: The changed dynamic from intermission creates new possibilities:
      - Physical closeness choices (her hand near yours, do you take it? avoid it? acknowledge it?)
      - Processing revelations from intermission conversation through action or silence
      - Parallel moments where stage dialogue directly mirrors your situation 
      - Final decision points as the play reaches its climax
      - Shared reactions to the play's resolution that reflect your own choices

      SCENE ENDING: Build toward the stage play's final curtain and applause. When 
      the final bow is taken and applause begins to die down, set the second_act_ended 
      flag. This creates urgency as the evening draws to a close.

    sketch: |
      The final curtain falls, and the audience erupts in applause. You and [C](character:c) 
      clap together, but the real performance—the one happening between you throughout 
      the evening—remains unresolved.

      As people begin to file out around you, the weight of decision settles in. 
      The evening has brought you both to this moment: the theater emptying, the 
      outside world waiting, and the question of what happens next hanging in the air.

      This is where the evening's choices culminate. Will you extend the night? 
      Part ways with new understanding? Or find some other resolution to the story 
      that began three months ago and resumed tonight?

    guidance: |
      The resolution. All the choices made in the previous scenes culminate here. 
      The player decides whether this is a beginning, an ending, or something in between. 
      The theater metaphor reaches its conclusion—are they ready to step into the 
      leading roles of their own story?

      SCENE PROGRESSION: This scene takes place after the play has fully ended. 
      The curtain has fallen, applause has died down, and now comes the real decision.

      DECISION TRIGGER: When the moment comes for C and the player to decide what 
      happens next (coffee, parting ways, etc.), set the decision_moment flag to 
      trigger the appropriate ending.

      Walking to the coffee shop, you both carry yourselves differently—lighter, 
      like people who've finally said what needed saying. The past three months 
      weren't wasted time but necessary distance, giving you both space to 
      understand what really mattered.

      Outside the theater, you part with the particular weight of acknowledged history. 
      Some relationships are meant to be remembered fondly but left in the past—
      precious but belonging to another time. You both understand this now, and 
      there's peace in that understanding.

      The conversation at the bar was enough—fifteen minutes of honest words 
      that explained three months of silence. Sometimes understanding comes 
      quickly, completely, leaving nothing more that needs to be said.

      You leave without addressing anything, both of you maintaining the careful 
      distance of three months ago. Some conversations aren't ready to happen. Some 
      truths are too fragile for this moment. The silence continues, 
      and perhaps that's its own kind of answer.

guidance: |
  CRITICAL - PRONOUN HANDLING:
  - Current pronouns for C: {c_pronouns} (check flag value)
  - Listen for how player refers to C in their actions/dialogue:
    * "I think she's..." → Set c_pronouns="she"
    * "He looks tired" → Set c_pronouns="he" 
    * "Tell them..." → Keep c_pronouns="they"
  - Once established, use consistently throughout your response
  - Update via: flagChanges: { values: { c_pronouns: "she" } }

  MEMORY AS PRESENCE: Focus on physical and sensory details that bring the past forward.
  Each gesture, object, or scent carries emotional weight. Let memories surface 
  naturally through the present moment.

  UNFINISHED BUSINESS: This relationship ended ambiguously, leaving things 
  unresolved. Each interaction reveals what went unsaid—sometimes healing, 
  sometimes painful, always meaningful.

  THE PLAY AS MIRROR: The play they watch reflects their situation through 
  emotional resonance, not theatrical metaphor. They're observers finding their 
  own story reflected back.
