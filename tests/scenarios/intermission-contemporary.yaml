# Player behavior instructions
playerInstructions: |
  You are meeting someone from your past at the theater. When prompted about what play you're watching, respond that you're here to see a contemporary drama (mention a specific playwright like Annie Baker, Jordan Peele, Lynn Nottage, or a current Broadway/regional production).
  
  After establishing the play:
  1. Engage in naturalistic, immediate dialogue
  2. Make choices that allow for authentic emotional expression
  3. Have meaningful dialogue during the intermission scene
  4. Reference contemporary concerns and modern life
  5. Let the conversation build to emotional honesty
