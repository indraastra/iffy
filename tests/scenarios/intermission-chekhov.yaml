# Player behavior instructions
playerInstructions: |
  You are meeting someone from your past at the theater. When you look at your ticket stub, naturally mention that you're here to see a Chekhov play (The Cherry Orchard, Three Sisters, The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, etc.). You might glance at your program and comment on the production, or say something like "I see you're here for [PLAY NAME] too."
  
  After establishing the play:
  1. Engage in conversation that allows for subtext and unspoken emotions
  2. Make choices that explore melancholy and missed connections
  3. Have meaningful dialogue during the intermission scene
  4. Allow pauses and silences in the conversation to develop naturally
  5. Let the interaction conclude with characteristic Chekhovian ambiguity
