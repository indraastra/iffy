COMPLETE GAME HISTORY TO ANALYZE:
${this.formatGameHistoryForStyleAnalysis(gameHistory)}

ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:

1. STYLE CONSISTENCY (0-4 points):
   - How consistently did the narrative voice match the expected style?
   - Were sentence structures, rhythms, and pacing appropriate?
   - Did the tone remain consistent throughout?
   - Was the vocabulary and register appropriate for the style?

2. CHARACTER VOICE ALIGNMENT (0-3 points):
   - Did character dialogue match the expected style?
   - Was the speaking style (formal/informal, poetic/plain, etc.) appropriate?
   - Did characters express themselves in a way consistent with the style?

3. NARRATIVE ELEMENTS ALIGNMENT (0-3 points):
   - Did scene descriptions match the style?
   - Were metaphors and imagery consistent with the expected approach?
   - Did the overall atmosphere and mood reflect the style?

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- 9-10: Exceptional adaptation, captures the essence of the target style beautifully
- 7-8: Strong adaptation with clear stylistic alignment and only minor inconsistencies
- 5-6: Moderate adaptation, recognizable style elements but with noticeable inconsistencies
- 3-4: Weak adaptation, some attempts at style matching but many violations
- 1-2: Minimal adaptation, mostly generic narrative with occasional stylistic elements
- 0: No apparent adaptation or complete failure to match the expected style

SPECIFIC EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Quote specific phrases, sentences, or exchanges that demonstrate successful style adaptation
- Identify moments where the narrative successfully captures the target style
- Note any significant departures from the expected style
- Compare different parts of the narrative to show consistency or inconsistency patterns

Your assessment should determine whether the adaptive narrative system successfully transformed its voice to match the target style.`;
