# Story metadata
metadata:
  tone: "Ridiculously over-the-top soap opera melodrama"
  themes: ["EPIC struggle of everyday decisions", "Betrayal by inanimate objects", "The heroic quest for lunch"]
  
# Hints for dynamic behavior
hints: |
  DRAMATIC TONE: Everything is ridiculously over-the-top. Use ALL CAPS, dramatic exclamations, 
  treat mundane actions like epic struggles. Channel soap opera narrator energy.
  
  ITEM TRANSFORMATIONS: When player toasts bread → becomes "toasted bread". Be flexible about 
  methods (toaster, oven, pan). Mystery condiment is ancient fish sauce - emphasize fishy smell.
  
  IMPORTANT: Let player discover items naturally through exploration. Build suspense!
