# Story moments (first moment is the starting point)
moments:
  quiet_moment:
    text: |
      You're sitting across from Alex in a quiet corner café. They've been acting distant lately, 
      and tonight feels different - like there's something they want to say but can't.
      
      The barista approaches, wiping her hands on her apron. "I noticed your coffee's 
      gone cold. Should I warm it up for you?"
      
      Alex doesn't respond, still stirring absently while staring out the rain-spotted window. 
      The barista glances at you with a gentle, questioning look.
    
    goals:
      - "Establish the intimate café atmosphere"
      - "Show Alex's distracted, troubled state"
      - "Begin building trust through patient responses"
    
    transitions:
      - to: "opening_up"
        when: "player shows patience and empathy"
        sets_flags: ["tone_established"]
    
    hints: |
      PRONOUN FLEXIBILITY: Start with they/them for Alex. If player uses specific pronouns 
      (he/him, she/her), adopt those consistently. Make it feel natural.
      
      OPENING DYNAMICS: Alex is lost in thought. Player's response to barista sets tone - 
      patient/caring responses help, pushy ones don't.
  
  opening_up:
    text: |
      The café feels even quieter now, just the soft jazz and distant clink of dishes being 
      washed. Rain traces patterns on the window that Alex watches like they hold answers.
      
      "I know I've been..." Alex starts, then stops, fingers wrapped around the cold mug. 
      "Different. Distant. I know you've noticed."
      
      Their eyes finally meet yours for just a moment before looking away again.

      Alex takes a shaky breath, and you realize whatever they're about to say has been 
      weighing on them for a long time.
      
      "The thing is..." Their voice is barely above a whisper. "I've been pulling away because 
      I'm terrified. Terrified of ruining everything between us."
      
      The words hang in the air between you, heavy with unspoken meaning.
    
    goals:
      - "Alex reveals their romantic feelings"
      - "Handle the confession with appropriate weight"

  deflection:
    text: |
      Alex's shoulders tense, and they lean back slightly. "It's nothing. Really. Just work 
      stuff. You know how it is."
      
      But you can see it in their eyes - that's not the truth. They're retreating, building 
      walls again. The unfinished coffee sits between you like all the things left unsaid.
    
    goals:
      - "Show Alex shutting down"
      - "Give player chance to salvage or end conversation"

        The weight that's been between you for weeks finally lifts. Alex's eyes are bright with 
        unshed tears, but there's relief there too.
        
        "I've been so scared," they admit. "Scared of losing you, scared of changing everything. 
        But keeping this inside was killing me."
        
        You reach across the table, and Alex doesn't pull away. Whatever happens next, at least 
        now it's honest. At least now it's real.
        
        Outside, the rain has stopped, and the streetlights glow like possibilities.

        Alex manages a small, sad smile. "I'm sorry I've been so weird lately. I'm dealing with 
        some stuff, and I didn't mean to shut you out."
        
        They stand, gathering their things. "Maybe we could take a walk? Clear heads?"
        
        You know there's more they're not saying, but at least it's a start. At least the door 
        is open. Sometimes that's enough for now.

        The conversation dies into uncomfortable silence. Alex checks their phone, a clear signal.
        
        "I should go," they say, already standing. "Early morning tomorrow."
        
        You watch them leave, the unfinished coffee still on the table. Whatever's troubling them, 
        they're not ready to share it. Not yet. Maybe not ever.
        
        The barista starts turning off lights. Time to go.

  conversation_flow: "Patient empathy → building trust → emotional revelation"

# Hints for dynamic behavior
hints: |
  REALISTIC DIALOGUE: Natural hesitations, incomplete sentences, meaningful silences. Show emotions 
  through actions (stirring coffee, looking away, fidgeting).
  
  EMOTIONAL PROGRESSION: Alex opens up with patience/empathy, shuts down with pressure. The secret 
  is romantic feelings for the player. Build intimacy gradually.
  
  ENVIRONMENTAL DETAILS: Use café atmosphere (rain, jazz, empty space) to reflect emotional tone.
