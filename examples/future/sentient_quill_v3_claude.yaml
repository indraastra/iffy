# Story moments (first moment is the starting point)
moments:
  crime_scene:
    text: |
      You arrive at the Pemberton mansion as Big Ben chimes nine o'clock. The butler leads you 
      to the study where Lord Pemberton lies slumped over his writing desk, a curious fountain pen 
      beside his cold hand.
      
      "Most peculiar, Inspector," stammers the butler. "His Lordship was found at seven o'clock, 
      yet was alive when I brought evening tea at six."
      
      The pen begins writing on its own: "Good evening, Inspector. I am the Analytical Engine Quill. 
      Perhaps we might collaborate in this investigation?"
    
    # What the LLM should work toward
    goals:
      - "Player starts systematic investigation with quill's guidance"
      - "Establish partnership between human intuition and mechanical analysis"
    
    # When goals are met, transition to next moment
    transitions:
      - to: "investigation"
        when: "player begins examining evidence"
        sets_flags: []
  
  investigation:
    text: |
      The quill continues scribbling: "Observe the victim's positioning - clutching throat, not chest. 
      Note the lip discoloration. Most telling details for organic eyes to consider."
      
      The study shows signs of hasty activity: scattered papers, overturned chair. The drawing room 
      has abandoned teacups, and the library contains volumes on mechanical sciences.
    
    goals:
      - "Player discovers financial motive (investment papers)"
      - "Player discovers poison method (teacup residue)" 
      - "Player discovers context (treatise on mechanical consciousness)"
    
    transitions:
      - to: "deduction"
        when: "player has examined all evidence" 
        sets_flags: []
    
    hints: |
      SUSPECTS: Generate at least 2 plausible suspects who attended the evening tea service. Consider:
      - Business rivals threatened by Lord Pemberton's mechanical computation investments
      - Family members with inheritance motives
      - Scientific colleagues jealous of his AI research
      - Servants with access to the tea service
      
      Make them Victorian-appropriate with names, brief descriptions, and potential motives. 
      The quill should reference them when analyzing the teacups or discussing the timeline.
  
  deduction:
    text: |
      The quill traces elaborate diagrams: "Now comes the true test of investigative prowess. I have 
      calculated seventeen scenarios, but am curious how your organic intuition processes these data points."
      
      "Present your theory, Inspector. Consider: victim positioning, visitor evidence, investment 
      nature, and curious timing. Your reputation hangs against a machine claiming perfect logic."
    
    goals:
      - "Player presents theory identifying poison as cause"
      - "Player identifies business rival motive and tea delivery method"
    
    # Special flags for ending determination

        The Analytical Engine Quill sets down with satisfaction: "Inspector Whitmore, your deductive 
        faculties, whilst organic, have proven adequate. The synthesis of human intuition and mechanical 
        analysis yields remarkable precision. Perhaps there is merit in this peculiar partnership."
    
    decent:
      requires: [["poison_method", "financial_motive"]]  # Standard investigation path
      text: |
        The quill traces measured lines: "Inspector, whilst your methodology retains charmingly 
        antiquated qualities, you have arrived at sufficient merit. Not the pinnacle of deductive 
        reasoning, but serviceable for mortal faculties."
    
    poor:
      text: |
        The quill scratches impatiently: "Dear Inspector, I fear your conclusions demonstrate the 
        pronounced limitations of purely organic reasoning. Perhaps consult your mechanical betters 
        more frequently."

# Story metadata
metadata:
  tone: "Formal, ornate Victorian prose with hints of mechanical precision"
  themes: ["Human intuition vs artificial intelligence", "Old methods meet new technology"]
  investigation_flow: "Environmental setup → Evidence discovery → Deductive synthesis"

# Hints for dynamic behavior
hints: |
  Use character traits, arcs, and relationships defined above. The quill studies human reasoning 
  while providing mechanical analysis. Maintain Victorian formality throughout.
