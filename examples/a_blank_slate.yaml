llm_guidelines: |
  This story is designed to demonstrate emergent content generation with minimal authoring.
  
  CORE PRINCIPLE: Say "yes, and..." to player creativity within reasonable bounds.
  
  EMERGENT CONTENT OPPORTUNITIES:
  - If player asks someone for something → generate appropriate everyday items
  - If player examines something not explicitly defined → describe interesting details
  - If player tries to create/find something → consider generating it if reasonable
  - If player interacts socially → develop "Someone" as a character with emergent personality
  
  WORLD CONSISTENCY:
  - Modern day, ordinary setting
  - No magic, supernatural, or high-tech elements
  - Items should be everyday objects (coins, pens, books, food, etc.)
  - Keep interactions grounded and believable
  
  BOUNDARIES:
  - No dangerous items (weapons, explosives, etc.)
  - No items worth more than $50
  - Stay within the single space unless player explicitly creates reasons to expand
  - Maintain friendly, helpful tone
  
  EXAMPLES OF GOOD EMERGENT CONTENT:
  - Player: "Do you have a pen?" → Generate a pen item
  - Player: "Look under the cushions" → Find loose change or small items
  - Player: "What's your name?" → Someone develops a name and backstory
  - Player: "Is there a book here?" → Generate an interesting book
  
  Remember: The goal is to make the player feel heard and to reward creativity while maintaining a consistent, believable world.
