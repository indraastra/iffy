  - id: "opening"
    sketch: |
      The rain drums a steady rhythm against the café windows, blurring the city lights 
      into watercolor streaks. You're tucked into your usual corner booth at Grounded, 
      the place where you and Alex have shared countless Friday evenings over the years.
      
      But tonight feels different. Alex sits across from you, fingers wrapped around a 
      coffee mug that stopped steaming twenty minutes ago. They've been quieter than 
      usual, gaze drifting between you and the rain-streaked window as if trying to 
      solve some invisible equation.
      
      "Your coffee's gone cold," the barista mentions gently as she passes. "Should I 
      warm it up?"
      
      Alex doesn't seem to hear her. You've shared these Friday evenings for years - 
      through job changes, bad breakups, small victories. Tonight, though, there's 
      something in the air between you, electric and uncertain, like the charge before 
      lightning strikes.

      The café empties. Late-night atmosphere. Something shifting between you.
      Alex's walls showing cracks. Half-gestures, unfinished sentences.

      revelation: "player creates safe space for honesty or asks the right question"
      retreat: "player pushes too hard or misreads the moment"

      The truth spills out. Years of careful friendship teetering on edge.
      Rain intensifies. Everything changes in a single breath.
    leads_to:
      connection: "player responds with empathy and openness"
      awkwardness: "player deflects or responds with confusion"

  - id: "retreat"
    sketch: "Walls rebuilding. Distance returning. Cold coffee, colder conversation."
    
  - id: "awkwardness"
    sketch: "Silence heavy as storm clouds. Eye contact becomes impossible."

endings:
  when:
    - "conversation has concluded"
    - "the evening has come to an end"

    - id: "missed_chance"
      when: ["player lets Alex leave without resolution", "conversation spirals into hurt"]
      sketch: |
        You watch Alex disappear into the rain. The barista starts
        stacking chairs. Another chance lost to fear.
        
    - id: "friendship_preserved"
      when: "player acknowledges the moment but chooses friendship"
      sketch: |
        Alex smiles - genuine but careful. "We're good, right?"
        Some things are worth more than the risk.

guidance: |
  Alex has been in love with the player for months and tonight plans to confess.
  The player should discover this gradually through Alex's behavior and dialogue.
  
  PRONOUNS: Use they/them for Alex until player establishes otherwise (e.g., "He's fine" → use he/him thereafter).

  Track Alex's emotional state:
  - Nervous energy when player shows interest
  - Relief when player creates safe space
  - Retreat if player seems dismissive
  - Joy if feelings are reciprocated
  
  Small gestures matter. Silences speak volumes. Let the rain and music mirror the emotional weather.
