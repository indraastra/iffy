    sketch: |
      Rain streaks the café window, fracturing the neon outside into pink and blue. 
      You're in your usual corner booth at Grounded, where Chet Baker loops endlessly 
      through the speakers.
      
      Alex sits across from you, half-lit by the window's glow, fingers tracing circles 
      on a cold coffee mug. In the glass, your reflections overlap with the city lights - two 
      ghosts watching each other.
      
      You've shared a hundred Friday evenings here, but tonight the silence between you 
      has weight. Something unspoken hums in the amber air.
      
      [What crosses your mind as you study Alex in the half-light?]

      sketch: |
        You watch Alex disappear into the rain. The barista starts
        stacking chairs. Another chance lost to fear.
        
    - id: "friendship_preserved"
      when: "player acknowledges the moment but chooses friendship"
      sketch: |
        Alex smiles - genuine but careful. "We're good, right?"
        Some things are worth more than the risk.

guidance: |
  Alex has been in love with the player for months and tonight plans to confess.
  The player should discover this gradually through Alex's behavior and dialogue.
  
  PRONOUN HANDLING:
  1. Always start with they/them for Alex
  2. Listen for player cues: if they say "She's nervous" or "He seems quiet", immediately adopt those pronouns
  3. Once established, maintain consistency - this should feel natural, not forced
  4. Example: Player says "She looks sad" → Use she/her for Alex from that point forward
  
  Track Alex's emotional state:
  - Nervous energy when player shows interest
  - Relief when player creates safe space
  - Retreat if player seems dismissive
  - Joy if feelings are reciprocated
  
  Small gestures matter. Silences speak volumes. Let the rain and music mirror the emotional weather.
