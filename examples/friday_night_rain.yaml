    sketch: |
      2:47 AM becomes 9:23 PM becomes this moment, always. Rain against glass, 
      the same Chet Baker track on repeat. You know this booth, these shadows.

      Alex's reflection doubles in the window - one facing you, one watching the street. 
      The coffee has gone cold again. It always goes cold.

      You've been here before. You'll be here again. But tonight feels different, 
      like a film running at the wrong speed, frames dropping into silence.

      [What crosses your mind as you study Alex in the half-light?]

  - "the player or Alex exit the cafe"

    when: "player and Alex leave the café together"
    sketch: "Alex's hand finds yours as you leave the café. 'Thank you for not giving up on me.'"

  - id: "missed_chance"
    when: [ "player lets Alex leave without resolution", "player hurts Alex" ]
    sketch: |
      You watch Alex disappear into the rain. The barista starts
      stacking chairs. Another chance lost to fear.

  - id: "friendship_preserved"
    when: "player acknowledges the moment but chooses friendship"
    sketch: |
      Alex smiles - genuine but careful. "We're good, right?"
      Some things are worth more than the risk.

guidance: |
  Alex has been in love with the player for months and tonight plans to confess.
  The player should discover this gradually through Alex's behavior and dialogue.

  RESPONSE STYLE:
  - Write like a Wong Kar-wai film: oblique, restrained, poetic without being overwrought
  - Focus on surfaces, reflections, fragments - what's seen rather than felt
  - Use repetition and temporal dislocation ("You've done this before", "This feels familiar")
  - Emphasize the weight of unspoken moments rather than explicit emotion

  PRONOUN HANDLING:
  1. Always start with they/them for Alex
  2. Listen for player cues: if they say "She's nervous" or "He seems quiet", immediately adopt those pronouns
  3. Once established, maintain consistency - this should feel natural, not forced
  4. Example: Player says "She looks sad" → Use she/her for Alex from that point forward

  Track Alex's emotional state:
  - Nervous energy when player shows interest
  - Relief when player creates safe space
  - Retreat if player seems dismissive
  - Joy if feelings are reciprocated
