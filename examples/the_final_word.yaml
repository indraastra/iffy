author: "Interactive Fiction Collective"
blurb: "Run an underground bookstore where literature lives dangerously"
version: "1.0"

  In a world where books are banned, you operate a secret bookstore beneath an old print shop. Each
  day brings new seekers of forbidden literature, and each encounter transforms to match the style
  of whatever author they seek.

# Global guidance - applies to all scenes
guidance: >
  This is a story about literary resistance. Each visitor seeks specific authors/works, and the
  entire encounter should transform to match that literature's style. Player's morning activities
  influence who arrives and what they want.

        An archaic, motorized contraption with a heavy flywheel, generating both a coded tremor
        signal for the shop above and a trickle of electricity for the hidden lamps within. Its deep
        hum and subtle vibration tell discerning patrons that The Final Word is open. Operated by a
        lever. A small brass plate reads, *"Verba volant, scripta manent."*

  # Tutorial - First Day

    process_sketch: true
    guidance: >
      First day tutorial. Establish the world, introduce mechanics. The focus here is activating the
      Lumina Press to open the shop.
    sketch: |
      Pale morning light filters through grimy windows above. You descend the hidden 
      stairs to your underground sanctuary. Books line every wall - some safe, others 
      that could cost you everything. Today marks another day of literary resistance. 
      The **[Lumina Press](item:the_lumina_press)** sits silent, waiting.

  # Core Game Loop Scene - Shop is open, waiting for customers
  open_for_business:
    location: "the_final_word"
    guidance: >
      The shop is now open, its signal active, but no customer has arrived yet. Maintain a sense of
      quiet anticipation. Allow the player to perform minor, contemplative actions that reflect
      waiting (e.g., tidying, listening, settling in). Player's actions during this waiting phase
      should influence who arrives next. The next transition occurs when the player indicates
      readiness for a customer.
    sketch: |
      With a low rumble, the **[Lumina_Press](item:the_lumina_press)** whirs to life, its heavy flywheel 
      gaining momentum. A deep, steady hum permeates the very stone of the building, 
      and the warm glow of the lamps casts dancing shadows across the forbidden spines. 
      The coded tremor ripples subtly through the shop above, a silent invitation. 
      You are open. Now, you wait. The air is thick with anticipation and the scent 
      of old paper.

  # Tutorial Specific Customer - Aquinas
  aquinas_day:
    location: "the_final_word"
    guidance: >
      Embody scholastic philosophy completely: formal reasoning, theological precision, methodical
      argumentation, Latin phrases where appropriate. This teaches the pattern.
    sketch: |
      A soft, distinct **rap** sounds from the concealed door above, followed by the faint 
      creak of descending stairs. A scholarly figure enters, movements measured and 
      deliberate. Dust motes suspend in cathedral light as centuries of theological 
      inquiry seem to settle into the very air between you.

  # End of Tutorial Day
  day_one_end:
    guidance: "Transition smoothly, explain the daily cycle, prepare for infinite generation"
    sketch: |
      Your first customer departs, carrying hidden wisdom into the dangerous world.
      You silence the **[Lumina_Press](item:the_lumina_press)** and secure the shop. Each day will bring new 
      seekers, new styles, new risks. Tomorrow, anything might walk through that door.

      daily_preparation: "when you're ready for the next day"

  # Infinite generation cycle - Start of a new day (shop closed, player prepares)
  daily_preparation:
    location: "the_final_word"
    guidance: >
      Shop is CLOSED (Lumina Press is off). IMPORTANT: Generate interesting environmental details
      that the player can discover and interact with - askew paintings, disorganized book sections,
      personal items, etc. Let player's choice of what to engage with determine tomorrow's visitor
      type. Track their activities to seed the encounter.
    sketch: |
      Dawn breaks over your hidden sanctuary. The **[Lumina_Press](item:the_lumina_press)** is silent, 
      its heavy flywheel dormant. This quiet time belongs to you alone - to read forbidden 
      works, rearrange dangerous volumes, or simply breathe among the words that could 
      destroy empires. The shop holds many details waiting to be discovered. You'll 
      activate the Press when you're ready to face whatever literary hunger today will bring.

  # Core Game Loop Scene - Generic customer arrival
  open_day:
    location: "the_final_word"
    guidance: >
      CRITICAL: Based on player's morning activities (from daily_preparation) AND any waiting
      actions (from open_for_business), generate a specific visitor seeking specific literature. If
      multiple activities occurred, pick one arbitrarily. If no specific activities, generate any
      appropriate encounter. Immediately and completely adopt that author's stylistic voice for ALL
      elements: dialogue, description, atmosphere, pacing, themes.
    sketch: |
      A soft, distinct **rap** sounds from the concealed door above, followed by the faint 
      creak of descending stairs. Someone enters as if drawn by an unseen force, their 
      bearing, their first words, their very presence reveals what literary appetite 
      drives them to risk everything.

  # Core Game Loop Scene - Specific customer arrival (Hemingway)
  hemingway_day:
    location: "the_final_word"
    guidance: >
      Pure Hemingway: sparse dialogue, understated emotion, what's unsaid matters most, short
      sentences, iceberg theory, war themes. This encounter was triggered by specific player
      preparation or waiting actions.
    sketch: |
      A soft, distinct **rap** sounds from the concealed door above, followed by the faint 
      creak of descending stairs. A veteran enters, weathered and quiet. Something about 
      the shop's arrangement speaks to them. Rain sounds on windows. Words will be few. 
      What matters lies beneath the surface, in the spaces between what gets said.

      day_complete: "when the encounter ends"

  # Core Game Loop Scene - Specific customer arrival (Joyce)
  joyce_day:
    location: "the_final_word"
    guidance: >
      Stream-of-consciousness Joycean style: flowing thoughts, wordplay, Dublin references, complex
      internal monologue, experimental language. This encounter was triggered by specific player
      preparation or waiting actions.
    sketch: |
      A soft, distinct **rap** sounds from the concealed door above, followed by the faint 
      creak of descending stairs. Someone flows through the door like thoughts through 
      consciousness, eyes drawn to whatever modernist arrangement you've created, seeking 
      Ulysses perhaps or Finnegans Wake, the great sprawling beautiful mess of language 
      itself, words tumbling over words in the endless Dublin of the mind.

      day_complete: "when the encounter ends"

  # Core Game Loop Scene - End of a regular day
  day_complete:
    guidance: >
      Provide satisfying conclusion to the day's encounter. Note consequences, track any risky
      decisions for potential discovery ending, transition to next day.
    sketch: |
      Another seeker departs into the uncertain world, carrying forbidden knowledge.
      You secure the shop once more, silencing the **[Lumina_Press](item:the_lumina_press)**, knowing
      that tomorrow will bring fresh literary hunger to your door. Each day, the
      resistance continues one conversation at a time.

endings:
  when:
  - "player chooses to permanently close the shop OR shop is compromised through risky decisions"
  variations:
  - id: "voluntary_closure"
    when: "player decides their work is done"
    sketch: |
      You silence the **[Lumina_Press](item:the_lumina_press)** one final time. The Final Word has served 
      its purpose - not as a place, but as an idea. Literature lives now in 
      all the minds you've touched, all the conversations you've sparked. 
      Some endings are also beginnings.

  - id: "discovered"
    when: "accumulated risks finally catch up OR player serves obvious authority figures"
    sketch: |
      Your caution finally failed you. They found your sanctuary, but not what 
      matters most. The books they seize are just paper - the real literature 
      lives in memory, in whispered conversations, in hearts that refuse to forget. 
      The **[Lumina_Press](item:the_lumina_press)** falls silent, but its work was already done.
