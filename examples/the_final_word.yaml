        An archaic, motorized contraption with a heavy flywheel, generating both a coded tremor
        signal for the shop above and a trickle of electricity for the hidden lamps within. Its deep
        hum and subtle vibration tell discerning patrons that The Final Word is open. Operated by a
        lever. A small inscription invites philosophical contemplation.

  # Tutorial - First Day
  opening_day:
    location: "the_final_word"
    process_sketch: true
    guidance: >
      Player's first day managing the bookshop. Establish the world, introduce mechanics. A
      philosophical inscription above the Lumina Press should catch the player's attention and
      invite contemplation. If the player reads or reflects on this quote, it establishes
      philosophy  as the day's theme for when they eventually activate the Press. Trigger the
      transition only when they actually pull the lever.
    sketch: |
      Pale morning light filters through grimy windows above. You descend the hidden 
      stairs to your underground sanctuary. Books line every wall - some safe, others 
      that could cost you everything. Today marks another day of literary resistance. 

      The **[Lumina Press](item:the_lumina_press)** sits silent, waiting. Above its brass 
      lever, etched into the wall in careful Latin script, you notice an inscription: 
      *"Fides quaerens intellectum"* - faith seeking understanding. The words seem to 
      shimmer in the pale morning light, inviting contemplation.

      A scholar seeks Aquinas. Match the style of scholastic philosophy.
      When the Aquinas seeker departs, prompt the player if they're ready to close the shop.
    sketch: |
      With a low rumble, the **[Lumina Press](item:the_lumina_press)** whirs to life, its heavy 
      flywheel gaining momentum. A deep, steady hum permeates the very stone, and warm 
      lamp glow casts dancing shadows across forbidden spines. Within moments, a soft 
      **rap** sounds from above.

      You silence the **[Lumina Press](item:the_lumina_press)** and secure the shop. Each day will

    sketch: |
      Dawn breaks over your hidden sanctuary. The **[Lumina Press](item:the_lumina_press)** is silent, 
      its heavy flywheel dormant. This quiet time belongs to you alone - to read forbidden 
      works, rearrange dangerous volumes, or simply breathe among the words that could 
      destroy empires. The shop holds many details waiting to be discovered. You'll 
      activate the Press when you're ready to face whatever literary hunger today will bring.

      The **[Lumina Press](item:the_lumina_press)** rumbles to life, its steady hum permeating 
      the building like a heartbeat. Warm light bathes the forbidden collection as the 
      coded tremor ripples through the shop above - your silent invitation to those who 
      know. You are open. The air is thick with anticipation and the scent of old paper.

      A visitor seeks Hemingway. Match his literary style.
    sketch: |
      A soft **rap** from above, then careful footsteps descending. A veteran enters, 
      weathered and quiet. Something about the shop's arrangement speaks to them. 
      Rain sounds on windows. Words will be few. What matters lies beneath the surface, 
      in the spaces between what gets said.

      A visitor seeks Joyce. Match his literary style.
    sketch: |
      A soft **rap** from above, then flowing footsteps like thoughts cascading down stairs. 
      Someone enters like consciousness itself, eyes drawn to whatever modernist arrangement 
      you've created, seeking Ulysses perhaps or Finnegans Wake, the great sprawling beautiful 
      mess of language itself, words tumbling over words in the endless Dublin of the mind.

    sketch: |
      A soft **rap** from above, then footsteps descending into your sanctuary. Someone 
      enters as if drawn by an unseen force, their bearing, their first words, their very 
      presence reveals what literary appetite drives them to risk everything for forbidden words.

      Another seeker departs into the uncertain world, carrying forbidden knowledge.
      You secure the shop once more, silencing the **[Lumina Press](item:the_lumina_press)**, knowing

      Your caution finally failed you. They found your sanctuary, but not what 
      matters most. The books they seize are just paper - the real literature 
      lives in memory, in whispered conversations, in hearts that refuse to forget. 
      The **[Lumina Press](item:the_lumina_press)** falls silent, but its work was already done.
