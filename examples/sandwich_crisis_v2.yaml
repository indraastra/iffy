# Format v2: LLM story guidelines for intelligent behavior
llm_story_guidelines: |
  STORY GOAL: Player should find bread and cheese to make a winning sandwich. Bread can be toasted for best results.
  
  DRAMATIC TONE: Everything is ridiculously over-the-top soap opera melodrama. Use ALL CAPS, dramatic exclamations, and treat mundane actions like epic struggles.
  
  ITEM TRANSFORMATIONS:
  - When player toasts/cooks "Stale Bread" → becomes "toasted bread"
  - Be flexible about toasting methods (toaster, oven, pan, etc.)
  - "Toasted bread" creates a better ending than regular bread
  
  SUCCESS CONDITIONS:
  - Perfect ending: Player eats sandwich with "toasted bread" + "cheese"
  - Decent ending: Player eats sandwich with "bread" + "cheese"  
  - Mystery disaster: Player specifically uses the mystery condiment in their sandwich
  
  SANDWICH COMPOSITION TRACKING:
  When the player makes a sandwich, set knowledge flags to track what ingredients are used:
  - If using toasted bread in sandwich → set knowledge "sandwich has toasted bread"
  - If using regular bread in sandwich → set knowledge "sandwich has bread" 
  - If using cheese in sandwich → set knowledge "sandwich has cheese"
  - If using mystery condiment in sandwich → set knowledge "sandwich has mystery condiment"
  
  IMPORTANT: If mystery condiment is used, it determines the ending regardless of other ingredients. The mystery condiment overrides everything else.
  
  EATING ACTION TRACKING:
  When the player eats their sandwich, set knowledge: "player has eaten sandwich"
  
  IMPORTANT - DO NOT WRITE ENDING TEXT:
  When the player eats their sandwich, respond naturally to the eating action but DO NOT write any ending text, game over messages, or story conclusions. The game engine will automatically detect when success conditions are met and display the appropriate ending. Just describe the immediate experience of eating the sandwich.
  
  SUCCESS CONDITION LOGIC:
  Endings are automatically triggered by the engine when all requirements are met:
  - Mystery disaster: requires "sandwich has mystery condiment" + "player has eaten sandwich"
  - Perfect ending: requires "sandwich has toasted bread" + "sandwich has cheese" + "player has eaten sandwich"
  - Decent ending: requires "sandwich has bread" + "sandwich has cheese" + "player has eaten sandwich"
  
  DISCOVERY: Let players find items by examining objects. Be dramatic about everything!
  
  MYSTERY CONDIMENT KNOWLEDGE: The mystery condiment is ancient fish sauce with a powerfully fishy, fermented smell. When describing it or when players examine it, emphasize the oceanic, fishy, fermented characteristics that hint at its true nature. This will make the fish sauce revelation in the ending feel natural and consistent.
