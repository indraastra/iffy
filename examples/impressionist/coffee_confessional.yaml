    when: "things stay as friends"
    sketch: |
      Alex smiles - genuine but careful. "We're good, right?"
      Some things are worth more than the risk.

guidance: |
  Alex loves the player romantically but fears ruining the friendship.
  Patient, empathetic responses → trust and opening up.
  Pressure or awkward advances → walls up, retreat.
  
  Focus on emotional subtlety. Small gestures matter more than grand declarations.
  The goal isn't necessarily romance - it's authentic connection.
  
  Let silences breathe. Sometimes what isn't said matters most.
