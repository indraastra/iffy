scenes:
  - id: "arrival"
    sketch: |
      The brass pen moves across parchment without human touch:
      "Good evening, Inspector. I am the Analytical Engine Quill.
      Shall we collaborate on this most intriguing case?"
    leads_to:
      partnership_begins: "accepting the quill's help"
      skeptical_investigation: "dismissing the talking pen"
      
  - id: "partnership_begins"
    sketch: |
      The quill writes with mechanical precision: "Observe the positioning
      of the deceased. Note the angle of the teacup. Most illuminating."
    leads_to:
      evidence_gathering: "systematically examining clues"
      
  - id: "skeptical_investigation"
    sketch: |
      You ignore the pen's scratching. It continues anyway:
      "Your skepticism is noted, Inspector, but logic cares not for belief."
    leads_to:
      forced_partnership: "the quill proves useful"
      solo_investigation: "working without mechanical aid"
      
  - id: "evidence_gathering"
    sketch: |
      The quill provides running commentary as you investigate:
      "Fascinating! The chemical residue suggests almonds. Prussic acid, perhaps?"
    leads_to:
      breakthrough: "sufficient evidence gathered"
      red_herring: "following false leads"
      
  - id: "breakthrough"
    sketch: |
      The pieces align. The quill writes rapidly: "Elementary, my dear Inspector!
      The railway investments, the threatening correspondence, the timing..."
    leads_to:
      confrontation: "ready to face the killer"
      
  - id: "confrontation"
    sketch: |
      You face the business rival in the drawing room. The quill
      continues writing evidence as you speak, building an unshakeable case.

endings:
  - id: "brilliant_deduction"
    when: ["found poison", "identified business rival", "partnership with quill"]
    sketch: |
      Human intuition paired with mechanical analysis yields perfect deduction.
      The quill writes: "A most satisfactory collaboration, Inspector."
      
  - id: "solo_success"
    when: ["found poison", "identified business rival", "worked alone"]
    sketch: |
      Your investigation succeeds through traditional methods. The quill
      scratches softly: "Perhaps there is wisdom in the old ways after all."
      
  - id: "incomplete_case"
    when: ["missing crucial evidence", "wrong suspect"]
    sketch: |
      The case remains unsolved. The quill writes with obvious disappointment:
      "Logic requires complete data, Inspector. We have failed Lord Pemberton."
      
  - id: "technological_partnership"
    when: ["quill becomes trusted ally", "case solved together"]
    sketch: |
      As you close the case file, the quill writes one final note:
      "The future belongs to such partnerships, Inspector. Mark my words."

guidance: |
  The quill is pompous but genuinely helpful. It speaks in verbose Victorian prose
  with mechanical precision. The solution: Lord Pemberton was poisoned by his
  business rival over failed railway investments.
  
  Key evidence: poison residue (prussic acid/cyanide), threatening letter,
  financial documents showing motive. The quill can analyze evidence mechanically
  but needs human intuition for the full picture.
  
  Track the relationship between Inspector and quill - skepticism to grudging
  respect to genuine partnership. The quill should feel alien but useful.
  
  Maintain Victorian atmosphere with steampunk touches. The quill represents
  the coming technological age meeting traditional investigation methods.
