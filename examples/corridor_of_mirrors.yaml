      The corridor stretches before you, neither long nor short, lined with five mirrors
      that each reflect something impossible. Your own reflection fractures across them:
      
      - A white-coated researcher taking notes
      - A poet crowned with flowers
      - A detective in a fedora
      - A child with wide, wondering eyes
      - A figure reduced to pure essence
      
      The Keeper materializes beside you - a shifting presence that seems to exist
      in all reflections simultaneously. "Each mirror leads to truth," they say,
      "but truth has many faces. Which reality calls to you?"

      SUBJECT REPORT: MIRROR TRANSITION SUCCESSFUL
      
      Environment Assessment: Sterile laboratory facility. Temperature: 22.3°C. 
      Humidity: 45%. Fluorescent lighting provides optimal visibility.
      
      You are now SUBJECT-47. The Keeper appears as DR. MERIDIAN, clipboard
      in hand, wearing standard-issue lab coat (ID: LAB-COAT-7749).
      
      "Welcome to Reality Analysis Wing-C," Dr. Meridian states. "Your task:
      examine the provided stimuli and record objective observations. Emotional
      responses are contraindicated. Please proceed to workstation Alpha-7."
      
      Available equipment: microscope, measurement tools, data tablets.
      Hypothesis: This room demands pure objectivity.

      Oh, sweet wanderer of worlds, you step into summer's embrace where
      thoughts bloom wild as morning glories! The Keeper transforms before
      your eyes into the GARDENER OF VERSES, robed in moss and crowned
      with forget-me-nots.
      
      "Welcome, dear heart," they whisper, voice like wind through wheat,
      "to the garden where feelings grow tall as sunflowers and every
      word is honey on the tongue. Here, metaphors take root in rich
      soul-soil, and truth wears a gown of petals."
      
      Butterflies of half-remembered dreams flutter past your shoulder.
      The very air tastes of possibility and old rain. A fountain of
      liquid starlight bubbles nearby, and in its depths, you see your
      own heart reflected back, beautiful and strange.
      
      What seeds will you plant in this sacred earth?

      The rain started three hours ago and shows no signs of letting up.
      Just like this case.
      
      You're in my office now, champ. Name's KEEPER, though the street
      calls me THE INVESTIGATOR. Fedora hangs on the coat rack like a
      question mark, and the bourbon's getting low. This room's seen
      more broken dreams than a divorce lawyer's waiting room.
      
      "So you're looking for answers," I say, lighting another Lucky Strike.
      The smoke curls up toward the ceiling fan that hasn't worked since
      Roosevelt was in office. "In this business, answers are like good
      women - hard to find and harder to keep."
      
      The filing cabinet's full of cold cases. The coffee's colder. But
      the truth? That burns hot as a two-dollar pistol.
      
      What's your angle, stranger?

      Oh my! What a lovely visitor we have today! 
      
      You're in the most wonderful little cottage where everything is
      just the right size and painted in the happiest colors! The Keeper
      is now GRANDMOTHER WILLOW, with the kindest smile and cookies that
      smell like sunshine and love.
      
      "Hello there, little lamb!" she says, clapping her hands together.
      "Would you like some warm milk and a story? I have the most marvelous
      tales about brave little mice and talking flowers!"
      
      The furniture is soft and round, and everything sparkles just a tiny
      bit, like fairy dust settled on the windowsills. Outside, you can
      hear the happy chirping of birds who know all the best songs.
      
      This is a place where dreams come true and everyone is always kind.
      Isn't that nice?

      Space.
      
      You. The Keeper.
      
      The Keeper speaks: "Here, essence."
      
      Nothing unnecessary. Only what is required. The Keeper appears as
      THE ESSENTIAL - neither tall nor short, neither old nor young.
      Simply present.
      
      "Question: What remains when all story is stripped away?"
      
      White. Silence. Truth.
      
      You exist. The choice exists. Nothing else.
      
      Choose.

      As you step through the eastern portal, measurable changes occur:
      - Temperature rises 3.7 degrees
      - Humidity increases to 78%
      - Light wavelength shifts toward amber spectrum

    sketch: |
      You stand once more in the corridor, but now you understand. Each
      mirror doesn't show different worlds - they show different ways of
      seeing the same truth. The Keeper appears as themselves, finally:
      a teacher in the guise of whatever lesson you needed.
      
      "Reality," they say, "is not fixed. It bends to the story we tell
      about it. You have walked in five different truths. Which one felt
      most real to you?"
      
      The mirrors still shimmer, but now you see they all reflect you.

endings:
  when:
    - "player has visited at least three different rooms"
    - "player chooses to leave the corridor OR gains deep understanding"
  
  variations:

      when: "player has visited all five rooms AND understands the nature of narrative perspective"
      sketch: |
        You step back into your own world, but everything has changed. Not the
        world itself - your eyes. You now see the laboratory in poetry, the
        garden in hard facts, the office in fairy tale wonder. 
        
        The Keeper's final gift: the ability to choose your own narrative lens.
        
    - id: "partial_awakening"
      when: "player has visited 3-4 rooms AND shows some understanding"
      sketch: |
        As you leave the corridor, you catch glimpses of the other perspectives
        in your daily life. Sometimes the world feels like a lab, sometimes
        like a poem. You're beginning to see that truth has many faces.
        
    - id: "confused_departure"
      when: "player leaves without understanding OR visits fewer than 3 rooms"
      sketch: |
        You exit the corridor shaking your head. "Strange dream," you mutter.
        But sometimes, when you're not paying attention, you catch the world
        shifting between different stories. The mirrors left their mark.

guidance: |
  This story demonstrates how narrative perspective shapes reality. Each room
  has COMPLETELY different writing styles that you must maintain consistently:
  
  CLINICAL LAB: 
  - Use objective, scientific language
  - Refer to player as "SUBJECT-47" 
  - Include measurements, data, clinical observations
  - The Keeper becomes "DR. MERIDIAN" - professional, detached
  - Everything is measurable and categorized
  
  POET GARDEN:
  - Lush, metaphorical language full of imagery
  - Use flowing, emotional prose with rhythm
  - The Keeper becomes "GARDENER OF VERSES" - wise, nurturing, speaks in metaphors
  - Everything is described through natural and emotional metaphors
  
  NOIR OFFICE:
  - Hard-boiled detective speak, cynical and atmospheric
  - Use short, punchy sentences mixed with longer atmospheric ones
  - The Keeper becomes "THE INVESTIGATOR" - world-weary, street-smart
  - Everything filtered through crime/mystery lens with 1940s sensibility
  
  FAIRY COTTAGE:
  - Innocent, wonder-filled language like children's stories
  - Use simple, warm, reassuring words
  - The Keeper becomes "GRANDMOTHER WILLOW" - kind, nurturing, protective
  - Everything is magical and safe and good
  
  MINIMALIST VOID:
  - Extremely spare language - only essential words
  - Short sentences. Minimal descriptions.
  - The Keeper becomes "THE ESSENTIAL" - speaks only when necessary
  - Strip away all unnecessary elements
  
  CORRIDOR (neutral):
  - Balanced, descriptive but not extreme in any direction
  - The Keeper appears as their true self - a teacher/guide
  
  The key is DRAMATIC CONTRAST between rooms. When transitioning, show the
  jarring shift in perspective. The same events could be described completely
  differently in each room. This isn't just about different characters - it's
  about different ways of seeing and describing reality itself.
  
  The player should feel like they're experiencing five different games with
  five different writers. Maintain each room's style absolutely consistently
  until they transition to another room.
