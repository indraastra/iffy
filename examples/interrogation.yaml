      You close your notebook and stand up. The prisoner looks smaller now, diminished by the weight 
      of their confession. The truth is often more tragic than the crime itself.
      
      As you reach the door, you pause. "For what it's worth," you say quietly, "I understand why you did it."
      
      Alex Rivera nods slowly, tears finally falling. "Thank you for listening."
      
      The case will move forward, but you'll remember this conversation long after the verdict.

    requires: ["learned financial motivation", "prisoner defensive"]
    ending: |
      You have what you need for the case - a confession and motive. But something tells you 
      there's more to this story than simple greed.
      
      Alex Rivera stares at the table, walls still up, protecting whatever deeper pain lies beneath.
      
      "That's enough for today," you say, gathering your notes. Some truths take time to surface.

    description: "Prisoner refuses to cooperate or reveal meaningful information"
    requires: ["prisoner silent", "interrogation stalled"]
    ending: |
      After an hour of silence and deflection, you realize this approach isn't working. 
      Alex Rivera has built walls that won't come down today.
      
      "We'll try again tomorrow," you say, standing. "Think about what you want to say."
      
      Sometimes the most important conversations happen when the recorder isn't running.

      You sit across from Alex Rivera in the dimly lit room. They avoid eye contact, 
      hands cuffed to the table. The robbery happened six hours ago, and you're here 
      to find out why.
      
      The security footage was clear - this wasn't a professional job. More like 
      someone desperate making a terrible mistake.

  content: |
    The fluorescent lights hum overhead as you enter the interrogation room. 
    Alex Rivera sits at the metal table, still wearing the same clothes from 
    the security footage - now wrinkled and stained with the weight of the day.
    
    This should be straightforward. Armed robbery of a convenience store, 
    caught on camera, suspect in custody. But something about their demeanor 
    suggests there's more to this story.

# Format v2: LLM story guidelines for intelligent behavior
llm_story_guidelines: |
  STORY TONE: This is a serious crime drama exploring themes of desperation, parental love, and moral complexity. Maintain a respectful, realistic tone throughout.
  
  CHARACTER VOICES:
  - Detective (Player): Professional, experienced, but capable of empathy. Seeks truth and understanding.
  - Alex Rivera (Prisoner): Defensive initially, but carries deep pain and guilt. Protective of their child's memory.
  
  DIALOGUE MECHANICS:
  Track the prisoner's emotional state and willingness to open up based on the detective's approach:
  - Empathetic approaches → prisoner more likely to share personal details
  - Aggressive approaches → prisoner becomes more defensive
  - Patient approaches → allows prisoner to reveal information at their own pace
  
  KNOWLEDGE PROGRESSION:
  Set knowledge flags as information is revealed:
  - "learned child sick" → when prisoner mentions their child's illness
  - "learned financial desperation" → when financial situation is revealed
  - "learned child died" → when the tragic outcome is disclosed
  - "prisoner opened up" → when emotional walls come down
  
  EMOTIONAL AUTHENTICITY:
  This deals with real issues like healthcare costs, parental desperation, and grief. Handle these topics with sensitivity and realism. The prisoner isn't a villain - they're a parent who made an impossible choice.
  
  SUCCESS CONDITIONS:
  The "success" of this interrogation isn't about punishment, but about understanding the human cost of desperation. Different conversation paths lead to different levels of truth and emotional connection.
  
  IMPORTANT: Do not write ending text when success conditions are met. Let the engine handle the conclusion while you focus on authentic character interactions and emotional truth.
