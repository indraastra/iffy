title: "The Final Word v2"
author: "Iffy Collective"
blurb: "Run an underground bookstore where literature lives dangerously"
version: "2.0"
context: >
  In a world where books are banned, you operate a secret bookstore beneath an old print shop. Each
  day brings new seekers of forbidden literature, and each encounter transforms to match the style
  of whatever author they seek. This simplified version focuses on clear actions and direct
  transitions.

# Global guidance - applies to all scenes
guidance: >
  This is a story about literary resistance. Each visitor seeks specific authors/works, and the
  entire encounter should transform to match that literature's style. Be very explicit about what
  actions the player can take to advance the story. Always end scenes with clear, direct questions
  about what the player wants to do next.

      sketch: >
        An archaic, motorized contraption with a heavy flywheel, generating both a coded tremor
        signal for the shop above and a trickle of electricity for the hidden lamps within. Its deep
        hum and subtle vibration tell discerning patrons that The Final Word is open. Operated by a
        brass lever. A small inscription invites philosophical contemplation.

        A hefty volume bound in dark leather, containing Aquinas's greatest work on the marriage of
        faith and reason. You set this out yesterday after receiving a carefully worded request - 
        today's customer specifically asked for "the marriage of faith and reason."
      found_in: "the_final_word"
      reveals: >
        This philosophical masterwork awaits its intended reader. You remember the whispered 
        request: "Something by the scholar who proved God through reason."

  # Tutorial - First Day
  opening_tutorial:
    location: "the_final_word"
    process_sketch: true
    guidance: >
      Player's first day. Guide them to discover the book on the counter and understand 
      how it connects to the day's customer. The Summa Theologica sets up the Aquinas 
      encounter, teaching them that books left out determine who arrives. Only transition 
      when they actually pull the lever to open.
    sketch: |
      Pale morning light filters through grimy windows above. You descend the hidden 
      stairs to your underground sanctuary, ready for another day of literary resistance. 
      Books line every wall - some safe, others that could cost you everything.

      On the central counter sits the **[Summa Theologica](item:summa_theologica)** you 
      prepared yesterday after receiving that whispered request. The dark leather volume 
      lies open, ready for today's expected visitor who seeks "the marriage of faith and 
      reason." Above the counter, the **[Lumina Press](item:the_lumina_press)** waits 
      with its brass lever gleaming, ready to signal that The Final Word is open for business.

      **What would you like to do?** You could:
      - Examine the book you prepared for today's customer
      - Explore different sections of your sanctuary  
      - **Pull the lever** when ready to open for your expected visitor

  # First Customer - Always Aquinas themed
  aquinas_encounter:
    location: "the_final_word"
    guidance: >
      A scholar seeks Aquinas, matching scholastic philosophy style. Make it clear that 
      the book on the counter drew this specific customer - this teaches the core mechanic. 
      After the encounter concludes naturally, transition automatically to the next day to 
      begin the daily cycle proper.
    sketch: |
      With a low rumble, the **[Lumina Press](item:the_lumina_press)** whirs to life, its heavy 
      flywheel gaining momentum. A deep, steady hum permeates the very stone, and warm 
      lamp glow casts dancing shadows across forbidden spines. 

      Within moments, a soft **rap** sounds from above, then measured footsteps descending.
      Your expected visitor has arrived, drawn by yesterday's whispered arrangement. The 
      **[Summa Theologica](item:summa_theologica)** waits exactly where you placed it - 
      someone whose very bearing speaks of scholarly pursuit and the marriage of faith and 
      reason. This is how the underground works: careful preparation for those who dare to seek.

  # Main Game Loop - Daily Operations
  shop_cycle:
    location: "the_final_word"
    guidance: >
      This is the main daily cycle. The shop starts closed. Player can explore, read books,
      organize, or do other activities that will influence what type of customer arrives. Be very
      explicit: ask "What would you like to do?" and list options like "explore the shop", "read
      forbidden books", "organize your collection", or "open the shop" when the player seems
      unfocused. Only transition when they explicitly say "open shop", "pull the lever", or similar
      direct action.
    sketch: |
      **The next morning...**

      After yesterday's successful encounter with the Aquinas scholar, you've locked the shop 
      for the night and now face another day of literary resistance. The **[Lumina Press](item:the_lumina_press)** 
      is silent, its heavy flywheel dormant. The counter sits empty - no pre-arranged requests today.

      This quiet time is yours - to read forbidden works, rearrange dangerous volumes, explore 
      your collection, or simply prepare for whatever literary hunger today will bring. Unlike 
      yesterday's planned encounter, today's customer will be drawn by whatever you choose to 
      focus on during these morning hours.

      **What would you like to do?** You could:
      - Read from your forbidden collection
      - Organize books by theme or author
      - Explore hidden sections of your sanctuary
      - **Open the shop** when ready for today's unknown visitor

  # Customer Encounters - All visitors handled here
  customer_encounter:
    location: "the_final_word"
    guidance: >
      Generate a customer seeking specific literature based on the player's recent activities. Adopt
      that author's style for the entire encounter. This is NOT the first customer - that was
      Aquinas. After the encounter concludes naturally, transition automatically to the next day.
      One customer per day - this maintains the story's pacing and prevents exhaustion.
    sketch: |
      The **[Lumina Press](item:the_lumina_press)** rumbles to life, its steady hum permeating 
      the building like a heartbeat. Warm light bathes the forbidden collection as the 
      coded tremor ripples through the shop above.

      Within moments, a soft **rap** sounds from above, then careful footsteps descending. 
      Someone enters your sanctuary, drawn by whatever literary appetite your morning 
      activities have summoned. Their bearing, their first words, their very presence 
      reveals what forbidden author calls to them.

endings:

    sketch: |
      Your caution finally failed you. They found your sanctuary, but not what 
      matters most. The books they seize are just paper - the real literature 
      lives in memory, in whispered conversations, in hearts that refuse to forget. 
      The **[Lumina Press](item:the_lumina_press)** falls silent, but its work was already done.
