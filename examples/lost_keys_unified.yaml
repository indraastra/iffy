      You're standing in your living room, 30 minutes before the most important
      job interview of your career. Your keys are nowhere to be seen. Where did
      you put them last night? Think... you came home, you were tired, you must
      have set them down somewhere without thinking.
      
      The clock is ticking. You need to find those keys or figure out another
      way to get to the interview.
      
      Start searching! Check the obvious places first - couch cushions, coffee table,
      kitchen counter. If that doesn't work, think about your routine last night.
      You were carrying groceries and exhausted from work. Where would tired-you
      have dropped the keys without thinking?

      There! Your keys glint in the morning light, exactly where any reasonable
      person would have put them... if they'd been thinking clearly last night.
      
      You grab them with relief, check your watch - still 20 minutes to get there.
      Tight, but doable. You rush out the door, already mentally rehearsing your
      interview answers.
      
      Some days start badly but end well.
      
      You made it to the interview on time, keys found and confidence restored.
      Sometimes a little morning chaos is exactly the energy you need to succeed.

      Keys are still missing, but your old phone will save the day. You quickly
      open the rideshare app - 8 minutes for pickup, 15 minutes to get there.
      You'll arrive exactly on time.
      
      Sometimes the backup plan works better than the original. You'll deal with
      the keys later - right now, you have an interview to ace.
      
      The rideshare got you there perfectly on time. When you tell the interviewer
      about your morning adventure, they're impressed by your problem-solving skills
      under pressure. The keys can wait - you nailed the interview.

    Your alarm didn't go off. Or maybe it did and you snoozed it one too many times.
    Either way, you're now running 30 minutes behind schedule for the job interview
    you've been preparing for all week.
    
    Shower: done. Professional outfit: on. Resume: in hand. Car keys: ...nowhere to be found.
    
    This cannot be happening.
