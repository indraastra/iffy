      **Test Complete!**
      
      You have successfully tested the new flow transition system:
      - LLM responses were enhanced with flow content ✓
      - Transitions felt smooth and contextual ✓
      - No jarring content replacement occurred ✓
      
      The enhanced flow transition system is working correctly!

      **Welcome to the Flow Transition Test**
      
      You find yourself in a simple test room. This story will help verify that the new 
      LLM-enhanced flow transitions work correctly.
      
      Instead of abruptly replacing your contextual responses with pre-written content, 
      the system should now blend them together smoothly.
      
      Try pressing the button to trigger the first transition!
    transitions:
      - requires: ["button_pressed"]
        to_flow: "button_flow"
        description: "Transition when button is pressed"
    sets: ["test_started"]

  - id: "button_flow"
    name: "Button Pressed Phase"
    type: "narrative"
    location: "start_room"
    content: |
      **Excellent! Button Press Detected**
      
      The button press has been registered and a key has appeared! This transition 
      should have felt natural - the LLM should have acknowledged your button press 
      action and then smoothly incorporated this narrative content.
      
      Now try moving to the next room to test location-based transitions.
    transitions:
      - requires: ["moved_to_next_room"]
        to_flow: "movement_flow"
        description: "Transition when player moves to next room"
    sets: ["button_pressed", "first_transition_complete"]

  - id: "movement_flow"
    name: "Movement Test Phase"
    type: "narrative"
    location: "next_room"
    content: |
      **Movement Transition Successful**
      
      Perfect! You've moved to the second room and the transition system has 
      adapted to your new location. The LLM should have described your movement 
      action contextually before presenting this flow content.
      
      Try pulling the lever to complete the final transition test.
    transitions:
      - requires: ["lever_pulled"]
        to_flow: "final_flow"
        description: "Transition when lever is pulled"
    sets: ["moved_rooms", "second_transition_complete"]

  - id: "final_flow"
    name: "Final Test Phase"
    type: "narrative"
    location: "next_room"
    content: |
      **All Transitions Complete!**
      
      Fantastic! You've successfully tested all the flow transitions. Each one 
      should have felt smooth and contextual, with the LLM naturally incorporating 
      the flow content rather than abruptly replacing your actions.
      
      The test is now complete - you should see the success condition trigger shortly.

  TESTING STORY: This is a technical test of the new flow transition system.
  
  TRANSITION BEHAVIOR:
  When flow transitions occur, you should receive the flow content as context and naturally 
  incorporate it into your response. DO NOT just output the flow content verbatim.
  
  EXAMPLE GOOD TRANSITION:
  Player presses button → 
  "You press the red button firmly. Click! The button depresses with a satisfying sound, 
  and immediately you notice something has changed. A small compartment opens in the wall, 
  revealing a brass key that wasn't there before. 
  
  **Excellent! Button Press Detected** - The button press has been registered and a key 
  has appeared! This transition should have felt natural..."
  
  EXAMPLE BAD TRANSITION (what we're trying to avoid):
  Player presses button → 
  "**Excellent! Button Press Detected** - The button press has been registered..."
  (No acknowledgment of the actual button pressing action)
  
  FLAG SETTING:
  - Set "button_pressed" when player presses the button
  - Set "moved_to_next_room" when player moves east/to next room  
  - Set "lever_pulled" when player pulls the lever
  
  GOAL: Make transitions feel like one coherent narrative response, not two separate pieces stuck together.
