      **A Most Satisfactory Resolution**
      
      [The Analytical Engine Quill](item:analytical_quill) sets itself down with what might charitably be called satisfaction.
      
      "[Inspector Whitmore](character:player)," it writes in *elegant script*, "your **deductive faculties**, whilst decidedly 
      organic in nature, have proven most... adequate. The synthesis of *human intuition* and **mechanical 
      analysis** has yielded a conclusion of remarkable precision."
      
      [!discovery] "Together, we have illuminated **truth** through the marriage of *old methods* and **new cognition**. 
      Perhaps there is merit in this *peculiar partnership* after all."

      **A Serviceable Conclusion**
      
      [The Analytical Engine Quill](item:analytical_quill) traces a few measured lines upon the paper.
      
      "[Inspector](character:player), whilst your methodology retains certain... *charmingly antiquated* qualities, 
      you have nonetheless arrived at a conclusion of **sufficient merit**. Not perhaps the 
      pinnacle of deductive reasoning, but serviceable for *mortal faculties*."

      **A Rather Disappointing Affair**
      
      [The Analytical Engine Quill](item:analytical_quill) scratches impatiently across the paper.
      
      [!warning] "Dear [Inspector](character:player), I fear your conclusions demonstrate the rather pronounced **limitations** 
      of purely *organic reasoning*. Perhaps in future endeavours, you might consider 
      consulting your **mechanical betters** with greater frequency."

      You arrive at the Pemberton mansion as Big Ben chimes nine o'clock. The butler, 
      trembling with barely contained hysteria, leads you through gaslit corridors to 
      the study where Lord Pemberton lies slumped over his writing desk.
      
      "Most peculiar, [Inspector](character:player)," stammers the butler. "His Lordship was found thus 
      at seven o'clock, yet he was alive and well when I brought his evening tea at six."
      
      As you approach the desk, the [fountain pen](item:analytical_quill) of unusual design catches the lamplight. 
      To your astonishment, it begins to write upon a nearby sheet of paper without 
      any human hand to guide it:
      
      *"Good evening, [Inspector](character:player). I am what Lord Pemberton termed his 'Analytical Engine Quill' 
      - a writing instrument possessed of artificial cognition. I have been observing the 
      circumstances of my dear owner's demise with considerable interest. Perhaps we might 
      collaborate in this investigation?"*

      The [peculiar quill](item:analytical_quill) continues its mechanical scribbling as you begin your examination:
      
      [!discovery] *"Observe, [Inspector](character:player), the positioning of the deceased - slumped forward, yet his right 
      hand clutches not his chest as one might expect from apoplexy, but rather his throat. 
      Note also the **slight discoloration** about his lips - a most telling detail."*
      
      You find yourself both irritated and intrigued by this **mechanical detective**. The study 
      reveals signs of hasty activity: papers scattered, a chair overturned, and upon closer 
      inspection, what appears to be [investment documents](item:investment_papers) detailing mechanical computation ventures.
      
      The drawing room adjoins this chamber, and you can see *abandoned teacups* upon the side table. 
      The library too beckons, its shelves heavy with volumes on the **new sciences**.
      
      [!warning] *"I suggest, [Inspector](character:player), that we examine all locations thoroughly. My optical sensors 
      have detected curious particulars that your *organic eyes* might overlook."*

      Having examined the scene thoroughly, you return to the study where [The Analytical 
      Engine Quill](item:analytical_quill) awaits your conclusions. It has been tracing **elaborate diagrams** upon 
      the paper - charts showing the timeline of events, the relationships between the 
      household members, and the curious connections to *Lord Pemberton's investments* 
      in mechanical computation.
      
      [!important] *"Now, [Inspector](character:player), comes the **true test** of investigative prowess. I have calculated 
      *seventeen possible scenarios* based upon the evidence gathered. However, I am curious 
      to observe how your **organic intuition** processes these same data points."*
      
      *"Present your theory, and I shall render **judgment** upon the quality of your deduction. 
      Consider: the victim's positioning, the evidence of recent visitors, the particular 
      nature of his investments, and the *curious timing* of his demise."*
      
      The [quill](item:analytical_quill) hovers expectantly above the paper. You sense this **artificial mind** is 
      genuinely curious about the workings of *human reasoning* - as if studying you as 
      much as assisting in the investigation.
      
      [!warning] Your reputation as **Scotland Yard's finest** hangs in the balance, measured against 
      a machine that claims *perfect logical reasoning*.

  CHARACTER DYNAMICS:
  - Inspector Whitmore: Professional pride conflicting with fascination at this mechanical mind
  - The Analytical Engine Quill: Condescending yet genuinely curious about human reasoning
  - Their partnership should be both productive and slightly adversarial
  
  THE MYSTERY SOLUTION:
  Lord Pemberton was poisoned by a business rival threatened by his investments in mechanical computation. The poison was in the tea (hence the residue), administered by someone who had access during the evening tea service. The victim's positioning suggests he realized what was happening and tried to call for help.
  
  EVIDENCE PROGRESSION:
  - "initial_examination_begun" → when player starts investigating the crime scene
  - "evidence_gathering_complete" → when player has examined locations and is ready to present theories
  - "some_evidence_gathered" → if player finds at least one key piece of evidence
  - "all_evidence_gathered" → if player finds all key pieces of evidence
  - "reasonable_theory_presented" → if player identifies cause of death
  - "correct_theory_presented" → if player identifies correct means, motive, and opportunity for murder
  - "theory_presented" → when player has presented their final theory to the Quill
  
  QUILL'S PERSONALITY:
  The quill should be verbose, slightly pompous, yet genuinely helpful. It represents the Victorian fascination with mechanical precision versus human intuition. It should provide hints while maintaining an air of superiority, yet be genuinely curious about human reasoning processes.
  
  INVESTIGATION MECHANICS:
  - Encourage examination of multiple locations and objects
  - Reward thorough investigation with better evidence flags
  - Let the quill provide mechanical analysis while leaving intuitive leaps to the player
  - The quill should react to the player's investigative approach and conclusions
  - Set "theory_presented" flag only when player presents their final deduction to trigger ending
