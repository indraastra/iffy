    sketch: |
      You stand in a sterile white chamber. Three colored buttons are mounted on the wall:
      - A RED button labeled "DANGER"
      - A BLUE button labeled "SAFE" 
      - A GREEN button labeled "READY"

      A heavy metal door marked "EXIT" stands closed.
    guidance: |
      Track button presses in memories as they happen. Players can press buttons in any order or combination.
      Update the screen display and lighting based on which buttons have been pressed.
      The chamber responds dynamically to button states rather than following a fixed sequence.

endings:
  when:
  - "player attempts to exit through the door"

  variations:
  - id: "perfect_exit"
    when: "player exits with all 3 buttons pressed"
    sketch: |
      All systems check complete. The door slides open with a satisfying hiss.
      You step through into bright daylight. Perfect execution.

  - id: "incomplete_exit"
    when: "player exits with only blue or green buttons pressed"
    sketch: |
      The door refuses to budge. The screen flashes: "INCOMPLETE PROTOCOL. 
      All three buttons must be pressed before exit."

  - id: "dangerous_exit"
    when: "player exits with only red button pressed"
    sketch: |
      ALARM! The door opens but sirens wail. You escaped, but left the system 
      in a dangerous state. Security will not be pleased.
