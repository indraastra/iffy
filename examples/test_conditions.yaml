      You stand before a security terminal with four buttons:
      - A RED button marked "1"
      - A BLUE button marked "2" 
      - A GREEN button marked "3"
      - A large CONFIRM button

      The display shows: "ENTER ACCESS CODE - PRESS CONFIRM TO SUBMIT"
      Current sequence: [None entered]
    guidance: |
      Track which buttons have been pressed in memories as they happen. Display the current sequence.
      Players can press buttons 1, 2, 3 multiple times or in any order before pressing CONFIRM.
      Only when CONFIRM is pressed should you evaluate the ending conditions.
      Update the display to show which buttons have been pressed in the current sequence.
